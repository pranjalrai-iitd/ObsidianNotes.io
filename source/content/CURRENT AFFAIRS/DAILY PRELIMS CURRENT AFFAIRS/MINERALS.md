### Silver & Climate Change:
#GS3 #Environment #Minerals #EnergyTransition #ClimateChange 
- **Data on Silver:**
	- Used to capture sunlight through **rooftop solar panels**
	- Each **mobile phone** contains about 100-200 mg of Silver
	- Each **laptop** contains around 350 mg of Silver
	- Only **15% of Silver** is **recuperated** and the rest is discarded.
- **Silver and Energy Transition:**
	- ***2025 Sprott Silver Report***: Silver demand is expected to increase by **170% a year**, due to the higher demand for **solar panels**.
	- **IEA** predicts that by **2035**, ***every other car sold worldwide will be electric***, which will increase demand for Silver.
- <b><u>NEWS:</u></b> **Finnish** researchers have come up with an efficient **chemical method to recycle Silver** - using ***organic fatty acids***, such as linolenic or oleic acids found in seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils.
	-  Traditional methods of silver recycling requires toxic substances like cyanide.
	- The proposed method can also be used for ***"Urban Mining"***, where silver retrieval from waste electrical and electronic wastes (**WEEE**).
- <b><u>SILVER PRODUCTION:</u></b>
	- **Country wise:** ***{"MCP"}***
		1. Mexico - 24.8%
		2. China - 13.2%
		3. Peru - 12%
	- **India** is **12th largest Silver producer**
		1. Rajasthan - 56.6%
			- *Khetri Copper mines*
		2. Andhra Pradesh - 12-15%
		3. Telanganga - 6-7.5%

- <b><u>NICKEL PRODUCTION:</u></b>
	- **Country wise:** ***{"IPR"}***
		1. Indonesia
		2. Philippines
		3. Russia
	- **India:**
		1. Odisha - 92%
		2. Jharkhand
		3. Nagaland
		4. Karnataka
- **Nickel Laterite Deposits:** *soil based* ores are often overlooked, but the new method particularly deals with Laterite deposits.
	- Contains 0.4-0.9% Nickel as ***nickeliferous limonite*** in ***chromite mine***.
	- In **India**, found in **Odisha's Sukinda** region
