### Thirstwave
#Gs1 #Geography #Climatology
- **Thirstwaves** are described by the ***extended periods of atmospheric thirst**
	- **Atmoshperic thirst** is measured through **Evaporative demand** 
- A thirstwave has **at least 3 consecutive days** when **daily evaporative demand** is **greater** than its **historical 90th percentile value for that period**
- **Evaporative demand** is driven by:
	- Temperature
	- Wind speed
	- Humidity
	- Sunshine
- Thirstwave studies can help **farmers** better manage their **water resources** and **improve crop yields**

### Blowout
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #NaturalGas 
- **Natural Gas leak** due to a **"blowout"** occurred in an **oil well** in **Assam**
- A **blowout** is an **oil/gas well accident** where **underground pressure forces gas/oil to the surface uncontrollably**
	- On its way out, the gas becomes **mixed with drilling fluid, sand** and shoots out at the surface in an ***uncontrolled jet***
- **CAUSE:**
	- **Valve failure** or **Underestimated pressure** leading to sudden release of **flammable materials**
- **RISKS:**
	- Massive fires
	- Explosions
	- Air pollution
---
### Cloudbursts
#GS3 #DisasterManagement 
- Cloudbursts triggers **flash floods** in the **Kullu district** of **Himachal Pradesh**
- **CLOUDBURSTS:**
	- It refers to heavy precipitation in a short period of time over a limited geographic area
	- **IMD** defines **cloudburst** as a **precipitation exceeding 100 mm per hour** over a geographic region of approximately **20 to 30 square Km**
- **CAUSES OF CLOUDBURSTS:**
	- **Orographic lift** - where moist is forced to rise over a physical barrier like a mountain
	- Occasionally when a **warm air parcel mixed with cooler air** resulting in **sudden condensation**
- **Cloudburst Disaster Risk Reduction(DRR)** under the **National Disaster Management Plan, 2019:**
	- **Understanding risk:** compile and maintain data on cloudburst events, Landslide hazard zonation, etc.
	- **Invest in DRR:** repair and maintain natural drainage systems, rivulets, etc., to ensure unhindered flow of storm water, etc.
	- **Capacity building:** enhance capabilities of local bodies to prepare and cope with cloudburst events, promote use of insurance, risk transfer, etc.
- **Best practice:** ***Cloudburst Management Plan*** of ***Copenhagen***
	- Focus on **nature-based solutions** - ***Blue-Green masterplan***
	- **Targeted (peri-)urban areas:
		- Parks and (semi)natural urban green areas
		- Blue areas
		- Green areas for water management
		- Urban green space connected to grey infrastructure
	- Collaboration of all stakeholders - **private and public**

### "SACHET" Disaster Alert System
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #EarlyWarningSystem
- The **NDMA** operationalised the **Integrated Alert System**, ***SACHET*** and a testing of the **Cell Broadcast (CB) system** is being conducted
- **SACHET:** India's *SMS-Based Alert System*
	- Developed by **C-DOT** using the **Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)**, recommended by the **ITU** (International Telecommunication Union)
	- It is active in all 36 states and UTs and sends a **geo-targeted SMS alert** during disasters like cyclones, floods, and storms
- **Cell Broadcast (CB) System:** *Near Real-Time Emergency Alerts*
	- Being developed by **C-DOT**
	- **CB** are broadcast **directly** to **all mobile phones** in the affected are
	- They are **much faster than SMS** and are ideal of *urgent disasters* like Tsunamis, Earthquakes, Lightning (not-notified) and Gas Leaks (not-notified)

### C-FLOOD
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #Flood
- **Ministry of Jal Shakti** inaugurates **C-FLOOD**, a ***Unified Inundation Forecasting System (UIFS)***, which will **integrates flood modelling outputs** from **national** and **regional agencies**, offering a comprehensive ***decision-support tool*** for disaster management authorities.
- It is a **web-based platform** providing ***2 day advance*** flood inundation forecasts up to **village level**, using advanced **2D-hydrodynamic modelling** to simulate flood scenarios.
- It is jointly developed by:
	- **C-DAC**
	- **CWC** (Central Water Commission)
	- **Department of Water Resources**
	- **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)**
- It will be executed under ***National Supercomputing Mission (NSM)***, which was jointly started by **MeiTY** and **DST**
- **Coverage:**
	- Presently covers ***Mahanadi, Godavari, and Tapi*** river basins, with ***plans to cover all river basins***
- The forecasts are integrated with the **NDEM** - National Disaster Management Emergency Response Portal

### Polar Anticyclone
#GS1 #Geography #Climatology 
- **Chile** and **Argentine** were ranked among the **coldest places of Earth** *outside the polar regions*, owing to the **Polar Anticyclone**
- **Polar Anticyclones:**
	- They are wind systems associated with a region in which **high atmospheric pressure** develops
	- They are created by the **cooling surface layers or air**
	- This cooling causes the *air near the surface to become denser*, which causes an **inflow of air** at **high levels** to replace the denser, sinking air.
	- This **increase the mass of air above the surface** creating an **anticyclone** - *high pressure system* with *winds flowing outward from the center*
		- **NOTE:** the anticyclone is outward and **CW** in North and **ACW** in South

### Changes in Floods
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #Floods #Report 
- **IIT Delhi** and **IIT Roorkee** have found that **riverine floods in India** are **changing** in terms of ***magnitude, size and intensity***, over the **past 40 years**.
- **Highlights:**
	- **Decline in flood magnitude:** Around 74% stations showed decreasing flood magnitude trends whereas 26% showed increasing trends.
		- ***Larger catchments experienced reduced flood magnitudes***
		- **Region specific:**
			- **West and Central Ganga basin:** saw **17% decline** per decade in *monsoon floods* due to *declining precipitation* and *soil moisture*
			- **Narmada basin:** consistent *decrease* in the magnitudes of floods mainly on the account of *dam construction*
			- **Marathwada region:** river flows are **decreasing at 8%** during Monsoon and **31%** in pre-Monsoon season
	- **Rise in pre-Monsoon Flood intensity:** increase of **8%** per decade in *pre-monsoon flood intensity* particularly on the **Malabar coast** due to ***rising pre-Monsoon rainfall**
	- **Shift in flood timing:** 
		- **Upper Ganga** - ***delayed floods***
		- **Central India** - ***earlier floods***
		- **Southern India** - generally sees ***later floods***
- **Implications:**
	- **Reservoir operations and water security:** declining floods may mean **lower reservoir levels** affecting water supply, irrigation and hydropwer.
	- **Overhauling of flood management system:** increased focus on **early warning systems**, ***green buffers***, **smart planning** and **resilient infrastructure**.

### Catastrophe Bonds (Cat Bonds)
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #MainsValueAddition 
- It is a **financial instrument** that transfers **catastrophic insurance risk** to **investors**, who receive **high yields** but may **loose their principal** if a specific **pre-defined** disaster occurs.
- It could include **earthquake, hurricanes, floods,** and other **extreme events**.
- **Climate change** and the **increased frequency** of natural disasters are making ***Cat Bonds*** more important in the insurance industry.
- **Government funded Cat Bonds are the need of the hour***
- However, there is a disadvantage that if the bond pre-defined a threshold of 6.6M Earthquake, then even at 6.5M Earthquake the principal amount will not be disbursed, despite same amount of damage.
>***Nobel Prize-winner Harry Markowitz had famously stated that risk diversification is “truly the only free lunch in finance”.***
