### Maritime Disasters
#GS3 #DisasterManagement
- **News**: A cargo ship caught fire off the coast of Kerala and drifted within India's EEZ.
- Rescue work by **Indian Coast Guards (ICG)**
- **Impact**:
	- **Environment**: marine pollution, loss of biodiversity, ballast water contamination.
	- **Health**: toxic chemicals can affect the local fishing communities.
	- **Economic loss**: devaluation of the shores, beach cleanup operations, loss of costal livelihoods, tourism deteriorates, shipping delays.
- **Various International Conventions under IMO related to maritime disasters and pollution**: #MainsValueAddition 
	- <b><u>Bunker Convention (2001)</u></b>: #convention Holds shipowners liable for bunker oil pollution i.e, **civil liability**. Ensures victim compensation and compulsory insurance.
		- ðŸš« India is **NOT** a member
	- <b><u>Nirobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks(2007)</u></b>: #convention **Legally binding** for states to remove shipwrecks that may effect the safety.
		- ðŸš« India is **NOT** a member
	- <b><u>HNS Convention (1996)</u></b>: #convention to ensure compensation for damages, cleanup and reinstatement measures.
		- ðŸš« India is **NOT** a member
	- <b><u>MAROPL Convention (1973)</u></b>: #convention preventing marine pollution from ships specifically addressing oil pollution prevention and control.
		- âœ… India is a member
- **UNCLOS --> defines EEZ**:

### Forest Fires:
#GS3 #DisasterManagement 
- <b><u>NEWS:</u></b> Forest fires in **Reasi** district of **J&K** expanded across hundreds of hectares of forest land.
- **Causes:**
	- ***Natural:***
		1. Lightning
		2. Prolonged droughts
		3. Dry winds like **Santa Ana winds** caused **California** wildfires
	- ***Anthropogenic:***
		1. **Slash-and-Burn Agriculture:** like *Jhum cultivation*
		2. **Negligence:** careless disposal of cigarettes, unattended campfires by tourists
		3. **Climate change:** extended dry spells, heat waves, rainfall variability, and *Hydro-climatic whiplash* due to human induced climate change
- **Existing Measures to Prevent and Mitigate Forest Fires:**
	- **Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme (FPMFS):** Centrally funded program dedicated to assisting states in prevention, preparedness and management of forest fires.
	- **National Action Plan on Forest Fires:** aims to minimize forest fires through **community involvement** and **technology integration**.
	- **Forest Fire Alert System (FIRE 3.0)** by the **FSI**: is an **Early Warning System** using:
		- **MODIS** (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
		- **SNPP-VIIRS** (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) **satellite** data
--- ### Global Drought Outlook 2025
#GS1 #GS3 #DisasterManagement #Report #Data #MainsValueAddition 
- Report released by **OECD** (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)
- **Findings:**
	- **Increase in severity:** ***40%*** of the **world's land area** faces increasingly frequent and severe droughts
	- **Economic impact:** ***3%-7.5%*** **annual increase** in the **economic cost** of an average drought episode
		- **Inland waterways** are adversely affected
		- **Crop yields** can decline by **22%**
	- **Ecological impact:**
		- **Reduction in soil moisture:** since 1980, **37%** of global land has experienced significant moisture decline
		- **Ground-water decline:** falling globally, with **62%** monitored aquifers in deline
- **WMO, 2021:** Droughts are responsible for **34% of disaster-related deaths** and exacerbate **poverty, inequality and displacement**
- **Types of droughts:**
	1. **Meteorological droughts**
	2. **Hydrological droughts**
	3. **Agricultural (Ecological) droughts**

		</p>
- **Initiatives for prevention of droughts:**
	- **Global:**
		- **UNCCD** convention to combat desertification - to achieve **Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN)** by **2030**
		- **International Drought Management Program**, jointly led by the World Meteorological Organization **(WMO)** and the **Global Water Partnership**
		- **India:**
			- National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System **(NADAMS)**
			- **Watershed Development**, a component of **WDC-PMKSY**
			- **Atal Bhujal Yojana**

### Thirstwave
#Gs1 #Geography #Climatology
- **Thirstwaves** are described by the ***extended periods of atmospheric thirst**
	- **Atmoshperic thirst** is measured through **Evaporative demand** 
- A thirstwave has **at least 3 consecutive days** when **daily evaporative demand** is **greater** than its **historical 90th percentile value for that period**
- **Evaporative demand** is driven by:
	- Temperature
	- Wind speed
	- Humidity
	- Sunshine
- Thirstwave studies can help **farmers** better manage their **water resources** and **improve crop yields**

### Blowout
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #NaturalGas 
- **Natural Gas leak** due to a **"blowout"** occurred in an **oil well** in **Assam**
- A **blowout** is an **oil/gas well accident** where **underground pressure forces gas/oil to the surface uncontrollably**
	- On its way out, the gas becomes **mixed with drilling fluid, sand** and shoots out at the surface in an ***uncontrolled jet***
- **CAUSE:**
	- **Valve failure** or **Underestimated pressure** leading to sudden release of **flammable materials**
- **RISKS:**
	- Massive fires
	- Explosions
	- Air pollution

### Cloudbursts
#GS3 #DisasterManagement 
- Cloudbursts triggers **flash floods** in the **Kullu district** of **Himachal Pradesh**
- **CLOUDBURSTS:**
	- It refers to heavy precipitation in a short period of time over a limited geographic area
	- **IMD** defines **cloudburst** as a **precipitation exceeding 100 mm per hour** over a geographic region of approximately **20 to 30 square Km**
- **CAUSES OF CLOUDBURSTS:**
	- **Orographic lift** - where moist is forced to rise over a physical barrier like a mountain
	- Occasionally when a **warm air parcel mixed with cooler air** resulting in **sudden condensation**
- **Cloudburst Disaster Risk Reduction(DRR)** under the **National Disaster Management Plan, 2019:**
	- **Understanding risk:** compile and maintain data on cloudburst events, Landslide hazard zonation, etc.
	- **Invest in DRR:** repair and maintain natural drainage systems, rivulets, etc., to ensure unhindered flow of storm water, etc.
	- **Capacity building:** enhance capabilities of local bodies to prepare and cope with cloudburst events, promote use of insurance, risk transfer, etc.
- **Best practice:** ***Cloudburst Management Plan*** of ***Copenhagen***
	- Focus on **nature-based solutions** - ***Blue-Green masterplan***
	- **Targeted (peri-)urban areas:
		- Parks and (semi)natural urban green areas
		- Blue areas
		- Green areas for water management
		- Urban green space connected to grey infrastructure
	- Collaboration of all stakeholders - **private and public**
