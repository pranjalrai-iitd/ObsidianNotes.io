		3. ***Paletwa*** to ***Zorinpui** (Mizoram)* via 4-lane ***highway***
		4. ***Zorinpui** (Mizoram)* to ***Aizwal*** and beyond through ***high-speed corridor***
- **Significance:**
	- **End geographic isolation of NER:** by providing alternate connectivity to the NER bypassing the geostrategic *Chicken's neck corridor.*
	- **Logistic cost and time:** for the goods from Kolkata to Aizwal will **drop by 50%**
	- **Develop NER as a business hub:** through boosting **trade** and establish **expoty-oriented industries**
- **Other connectivity projects for NER:***
	- ***India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway Project:*** connects **Moreh (Manipur)** to **Mae Sot (Thailand)** via **Myanmar**

### EC Chief calls for an alternative to WTO
#GS2 #IR #WTO #Trade #InternationalOrganizations 
- A suggestion was made by *Ursula van der leyen,* the **European Commission chief,** for a **Europe-led trade initiative with Asian countries** to create a **new trade cooperation framework**, as the **WTO remains stalled.**
	- The proposed initiative will contain **EU and 11 countries** of the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**
		- ***INIDA IS NOT A MEMBER OF CPTPP***
- **Mains challenges with WTO:**
	- **Dispute settlement paralysis:** since 2016, USA has blocked appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body
		- This has made the **dispute Settlement system non-functional**, weakening global rule enforcement.
		- ***WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM:*** Two (2) main ways:
			1. **Mutually Agreed Solution:** particularly during the phase of bilateral consultations
			2. **Through Adjudication:** 
				- Ruling by **Dispute Settlement *Panel***
				- Then possible challenge at **Appellate body**
					- ***WTO Dispute Appellate Body:**
						- Apex body for dispute settlements
						- Composition: ***7 members*** appointed by the **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)**
							- ***DSB*** - composed of all WTO members
	- **Inequity in the system:** WTO is often seen as favoring **developed countries**, Developing nations struggle to fully participate in international trade due to high trade barriers, poor infrastructure, and limited resources.
		- #Eg **Fisheries subsidies** favours *developed countries*
		- WTO members have **not been able to agree on new rules on agricultural goods** due to such conflicts
	- **Opaque decision-making:** with **lack of transparency** and limited involvement of developing countries creating *mistrust* and questions the WTO's legitimacy.
	- **Rise of Regional and Bilateral Trade Blocs:** more countries are forming regional and bilateral trade pacts like, **CPTPP, AfCFTA**
		- These frameworks weakens the WTO's roles and risks creating fragmented global trade rules.
	- **US-Chine trade conflicts:** *unilateral actions*  ( #Eg *US tariffs on steel*) and ongoing tensions strain WTO operations.
