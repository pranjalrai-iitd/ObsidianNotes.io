### STATE & TRENDS OF CARBON PRICING REPORT 2025
#GS3 #Environment #ClimateChange #Report 
- By **World Bank**
- **Carbon Pricing (CP):** policy tools that assign cost to GHG emissions
	- **Carbon Taxes:** fee levied on certain carbon-intensive entities.
	- **Emissions Trading Systems:** govt. places a **limit** on the amount/intensity of GHG emissions generated by covered entities.
	- **Carbon Crediting Mechanisms:** **Tradable credits** generated through **voluntary activities** that reduce emissions.
- **Highlights:**
	1. **Coverage:** Carbon pricing(CP) covers around **28%** of the **GHG emissions** with around 43 ***Carbon-Taxes*** and 37 ***Emission Trading Systems(ETs)***
	2. **Revenue Generation:** ETs and Carbon-Taxes generate **$100 Bn (2024)** for public budgets
	3. **Sector wise coverage:**
		1. **Power**
		2. **Industry**
		- **Agriculture** and **Waste** are largely **uncovered**
	4. **Carbon credit supply vs demand:** supply outstrips demand by **1 billion tons** of un-retired credits in 2024, globally.
- **Global Examples:**
	- **Article 6 of Paris Agreement (COP21, UNFCC):** international recognition
		- **COP29 (Baku)** adopted final rules for 
			- <b><u>Article 6.2:</u></b> ***Cooperative approaches***
			- <b><u>Article 6.4:</u></b> ***Paris agreement crediting mechanisms***
- **Carbon Pricing in India:**
	- **Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (2023):** under the **Energy Conservation Act, 2001** and offers two mechanisms:
		1. **Compliance Mechanism:** ***obligated entities*** to comply with prescribed GHG emission reduction norms
		2. **Offset Mechanism:** ***Non-obligated entities*** registers projects for GHG emission reduction/removal/avoidance for Carbon Credit Certificates.
	- **ECOMARK:** for voluntary practices by **CPCB** and **BIS** under the **EPA, 1986**

- <b><u>NOTE:</u></b> **PAT** schemes with **Energy Saving Certificates** by **BEE** under the **Energy Conservation Act, 2001**

### Global Ocean Darkening
#GS3 #Environment 
- #Data #MainsValueAddition Recent study found out that **21% of the global ocean had become darker** between 2003 and 2022, especially in the Arctic, Antarctic, and the Gulf Stream.
- **Darkening of the Ocean:**
	- It refers to **reduction in light penetration** into the global oceans, **shrinking the photic zone**
		- **Photic zone:** is the **sunlit layer**(~200m) where most **90% marine life** thrives
- **Reasons for Ocean darkening:**
	- Due to **ecological shifts** and,
	- **Phytoplankton & zooplankton blooms**
	- **Specific reasons:
		- In **coastal oceans:**
			- Combination of *nutrient, organic material and sedimentation loading* near the coast, caused by:
				- *Agricultural runoff*
				- *Increased rainfall*
		- In **open oceans:**
				- Driven by *warming of the surface oceans* leading to *algal bloom*
			- *Climate driven* changes in *ocean circulation patterns*
- **Impact of the Ocean Darkening:**
	- On **marine ecology and productivity:** ocean darkening **limits light-dependent processes** such as *growth, communication, reproduction, photosynthesis, etc.* thus, limiting ocean productivity
	- **Fisheries industry:** *fish stocks decline* due to **habitat compression** and **disrupted reproductive cycles**
	- **Regulation of climate:** hampers **carbon absorption** and **oxygen production**

### Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
#GS1 #Geography #OceanCurrents #Environment #ClimateChange 
- A recent study found out that under moderate emissions, **global warming may not be enough to offset the cooling** caused by a potential collapse of the AMOC
- **AMOC:**
	- A system of ocean currents that **circulates water within the Atlantic Ocean, bringing warm water North and cold water South**
	<p align="center">
	<img src="https://globalchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMOC-graphic-Oceanography-2-1024x487.jpg" alt="AMOC" width="500"/>
	</p>

	- **Mechanism of AMOC:** based on **temperature and salinity differences:**
		- ***Warm surface water moves towards poles*** and cools down
		- As sea ice forms, it leaves behind salt, making surrounding water denser
		- ***Dense cool water sinks and flows southward*** at ***deep ocean levels***
		- This **deep water eventually rises** again through upwelling, warms up, and restarts the cycle
- **Significance of AMOC:**
	- AMOC is a part of a, **"global conveyor belt"** of ocean currents, exchanging cool and warm water
	- AMOC helps **distribute heat, moisture, and nutrients** across oceans over long periods of time
	- **Carbon sequestration** as carbon rich nutrients go deep into the ocean ad remain for decades
- **Reasons for weakening of AMOC:** ***Climate Change***
	- Melting of ice adds cold, fresh water to north Atlantic, therby reducing water's salinity and density
	- The dense water becomes scarce, weakening the AMOC
- **Impact of AMOC weakening:** ***Climate tipping point***
	- **Climate disruptions:** even with a slight weakening of the AMOC
		- **Cool Europe** and changes in **precipitation patterns** of Europe, South America and Africa
		- Affect the **timing of Indian monsson**
		- Lead the **tropical rain belt to shift southwards**, resulting in **droughts over African Sahel**
	- **Threat to ocean life:** as fewer nutrients reaches the surface harming the marine food chains

Helps **regulate weather conditions** artificially - **reducing crop damage from hail storms**  #Eg ***Project Skywater*** of USA<br>4. Reduces **air pollution** - #Eg ***China used cloud seeding to reduce pollution during Beijing Olympics 2008***<br>5. **Wildfire mitigation**<br>6. Supplementary solution for **water scarcity**<br>7. **Ceremonial applications:** #Eg Russia uses cloud seeding to have clear skies before **parades** and **ceremonies** | 1. Can results into **floods and landslides:**   #Eg ***Dubai cloud seeding project*** resulted into unprecedented floods in 2024<br>2. Disturbs **natural weather patterns**<br>3. **Environmental damage** due to non-seasonal rains, which can negatively affect biodiversity<br>4. Once seeded, **difficult to regulate** and can have unintended consequences<br>5. **high costs** and **logistics**<br>6. **Limited scientific consensus** |
- It must be guided by **scientific research** and **adequate environmental safeguards** and **clear regulations**
- **Cloud-seeding in India and required permissions:** NOC from *13 agencies*
	- *DGCA, AAI, BCAS(Bureau of Civil Aviation), MoDefence, MoHome, SPG, MoEnvrionment, IMD, CPCB* and others
- **Efficacy:** 
	- Up to **15% increase** recorded in some countries like **Australia**
	- **Success rate** of up to **60%** as per IIT Kanpur
	- **UAE** runs one of the world's most aggressive and advanced cloud seeding programs, conducting **200 missions annually** with average increase of **22-30% in rainfall**
