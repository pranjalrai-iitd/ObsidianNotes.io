### Global Ocean Darkening
#GS3 #Environment 
- #Data #MainsValueAddition Recent study found out that **21% of the global ocean had become darker** between 2003 and 2022, especially in the Arctic, Antarctic, and the Gulf Stream.
- **Darkening of the Ocean:**
	- It refers to **reduction in light penetration** into the global oceans, **shrinking the photic zone**
		- **Photic zone:** is the **sunlit layer**(~200m) where most **90% marine life** thrives
- **Reasons for Ocean darkening:**
	- Due to **ecological shifts** and,
	- **Phytoplankton & zooplankton blooms**
	- **Specific reasons:
		- In **coastal oceans:**
			- Combination of *nutrient, organic material and sedimentation loading* near the coast, caused by:
				- *Agricultural runoff*
				- *Increased rainfall*
		- In **open oceans:**
				- Driven by *warming of the surface oceans* leading to *algal bloom*
			- *Climate driven* changes in *ocean circulation patterns*
- **Impact of the Ocean Darkening:**
	- On **marine ecology and productivity:** ocean darkening **limits light-dependent processes** such as *growth, communication, reproduction, photosynthesis, etc.* thus, limiting ocean productivity
	- **Fisheries industry:** *fish stocks decline* due to **habitat compression** and **disrupted reproductive cycles**
	- **Regulation of climate:** hampers **carbon absorption** and **oxygen production**

### Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
#GS1 #Geography #OceanCurrents #Environment #ClimateChange 
- A recent study found out that under moderate emissions, **global warming may not be enough to offset the cooling** caused by a potential collapse of the AMOC
- **AMOC:**
	- A system of ocean currents that **circulates water within the Atlantic Ocean, bringing warm water North and cold water South**
	<p align="center">
	<img src="https://globalchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMOC-graphic-Oceanography-2-1024x487.jpg" alt="AMOC" width="500"/>
	</p>

	- **Mechanism of AMOC:** based on **temperature and salinity differences:**
		- ***Warm surface water moves towards poles*** and cools down
		- As sea ice forms, it leaves behind salt, making surrounding water denser
		- ***Dense cool water sinks and flows southward*** at ***deep ocean levels***
		- This **deep water eventually rises** again through upwelling, warms up, and restarts the cycle
- **Significance of AMOC:**
	- AMOC is a part of a, **"global conveyor belt"** of ocean currents, exchanging cool and warm water
	- AMOC helps **distribute heat, moisture, and nutrients** across oceans over long periods of time
	- **Carbon sequestration** as carbon rich nutrients go deep into the ocean ad remain for decades
- **Reasons for weakening of AMOC:** ***Climate Change***
	- Melting of ice adds cold, fresh water to north Atlantic, therby reducing water's salinity and density
	- The dense water becomes scarce, weakening the AMOC
- **Impact of AMOC weakening:** ***Climate tipping point***
	- **Climate disruptions:** even with a slight weakening of the AMOC
		- **Cool Europe** and changes in **precipitation patterns** of Europe, South America and Africa
		- Affect the **timing of Indian monsson**
		- Lead the **tropical rain belt to shift southwards**, resulting in **droughts over African Sahel**
	- **Threat to ocean life:** as fewer nutrients reaches the surface harming the marine food chains

### SC-NBWL and ESZ guidelines
#GS3 #Environment #ESZ
- **Standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (SC-NBWL)** has suggested revising the ***Guidelines for declaration of ESZ, 2011*** issued by the **MoEFCC**
	- SC-NBWL states that a **uniform 10Km ESZ** around **all protected areas** is ***not practical*** due to varying local conditions
	- #Eg In **Himachal Pradesh**, about **65% land** is already under **forest or protected areas**, and strict ESZ rules may **hinder development** without significant ecological benefits.
- **ESZ: Eco-Sensitive Zones:**
	- **Genesis:** introduced in **Wildlife Conservation Strategy, 2002**
	- #Definition: The ***National Environment Policy 2006*** defines **ESZ** as follows:
		- Area with identified **environmental resources** having **incomparable values** which require **special attention for their conservation** because they feature landscape, wildlife, biodiversity, historical and scenic qualities.
	- **Purpose:** 
		- To create some kind of **"shock absorber"** for the specialized Ecosystem, such as Protected Areas (National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries) or other natural sites.
		- To act as a **transition zone** from areas of high protection to areas involving less protection.
	- **Demarcation:**
		- Lands falling **within 10km of the boundaries of Protected areas** should be notified as ESZ under the ***Environment (Protection) ACt, 1986***
		- In 2023, Supreme Court **allowed states to change the minimum width of ESZs** in ***public interest***
			- Court also **prohibited mining** within the national park and wildlife sanctuary, and **within area of 1 km from their boundaries**
- **Planning and Regulation of ESZs:**
	- **MoEF&CC notifies ESZ** on the **recommendations** of the **State governments**
	- **State governments** must prepare a ***Zonal Master Plan*** for **each ESZ:**
		- Zonal master Plan also mandates incorporating ***Tourism Master Plan*** and ***Heritage sites listing***
		- **No displacement** of people is involved.
	- **ESZ Guidelines 2011*** provides **Exo-Sensitive Zone Activity Classification:**
