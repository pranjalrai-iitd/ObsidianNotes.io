### Complex Proliferation Financing and Sanctions Evasion Scheme Report
#GS3 #InternalSecurity #FATF #Terrorism #Report #MainsValueAddition 
- Released by **FATF (Financial Action Task Force)** and highlights major vulnerabilities across the global financial system in **countering the Proliferation Financing (PF)**
- <b><u>Proliferation Financing (PF):</u></b> involves raising, moving or making available funds, other assets or resources to persons or entities for the purposes of ***Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)***, posing a serious threat to global security and international financial system.
- **Findings of the report:**
	- **Global Risks:**
		- Risk environment is characterized by *state and non-state actors* acquiring and/or sourcing *dual-use goods, technology, and knowledge* through the use of *procurement networks*.
	- **Global Gaps:**
		- Only **16% countries effectively implement targeted UN sanctions** to stop WMD proliferation
	- **Techniques used bu Illicit actors:**
		- **Use of intermediaries to evade sanctions:** *Procurement Networks* use *front/shell companies*, financial facilitators, and *third-country routes* to hide end-users.
		- **Concealing ownership:** *Falsifying beneficial ownership* obscures true parties, especially through *digital means*, complicating detection.
		- **Using virtual assets:** Sanctioned actors exploit *virtual currencies and new technologies* to bypass sanctions, moving funds directly or through *non-compliant countries*.
		- **Exploiting Maritime sector:** including ***"dark fleet"***, is exploited to *disguise vessels* and evade sanctions.
			- #Eg Indian investigators confirmed a *mis-declared dual-use* equipment on a Pakistan-bound ship
- **Recommendations of the Report:**
	- Regularly **update threat assessments** to keep pace with evolving **PF tactics**
	- **Enhance information sharing** to strengthen public and private sector's ability to **detect PF** and/or **sanctions evasion**.
	- **Add a WMD PF definition** to the **FATF Glossary** within five years to improve global coordination.
	- Conduct a **global review of PF risk assessments** within 3 years to **identify best practices** and strengthen responses.
