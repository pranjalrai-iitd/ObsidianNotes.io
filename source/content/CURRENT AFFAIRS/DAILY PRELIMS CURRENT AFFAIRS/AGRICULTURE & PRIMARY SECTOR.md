### State of World Marine Fishery Resources 2025 Report
#GS3 #Environment #Fisheries #Report
- By **FAO**
- **Data**:
	- Only **29% of deep-sea** fish stocks are being **sustainably fished**
	- **64.5%** of all fishery stocks are **exploited within sustainable levels**, while **35.5% are overfished**
	- **>50% of migratory shark stocks** are unsustainable
	  
- **Challenges:** late maturation, slow growth, infrequent spawning, **IUU fishing**
  
- <b><u>WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies at 12th MC 2022:</u></b>
	- Bans subsidies for vessels or operators involved in IUU fishing.
	- Prohibits subsidies for fishing overfished stocks unless measures are in place to rebuild them to sustainable levels.
	- Forbids subsidies for fishing activities outside coastal state jurisdiction
	- **India's concerns:**
		- What about small scale fishermen of India? They need subsidies but they lack technical supports compared to mechanized fishermen of developed countries.
		- Apply **"Polluter pays"** and **"CBDR"** principles.

### Japonica Rice and DAP
#GS3 #Agriculture #SciTech #Fertilizer
- Researchers at the **National institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR)** have used **CRISPS-Cas9** gene-editing technology to increase the ***phosphate uptake and transport*** in the ***Japonica rice varities.***
	- **40% higher yield** with the **recommended dose of Phosphate fertilizer**
	- **20% higher yield** with **10% recommended dose of Phosphate fertilizer**
- **Plant Nutrients:**
	- **Macronutrients:** in higher quantities
		- ***N, P, K, Ca, Mg,*** and  ***Sulphur***
		- ***C, H, O***
	- **Micronutrient:** in lower quantities
		- ***Fe, Mn, B, Mo, Cu, Zn, Cl, Ni, Co, Na, Si***
- **Role of Phosphorus in Plants:**
	- It is **essential mineral for plant growth** and its limited availability leads to productivity drops drastically.
	- It is noted especially for its role in **capturing and converting sun's energy** into useful plant compounds
	- It is essential for **stimulated root development, increased N-fixing capacity of legumes, improved flower formation and seed production, etc.**
- ***DAP supply squeeze caused by China***
	- **DAP** has **46% Phosphorus** and **18% Nitrogen**
	- China has reduced it's DAP ***(Di-Ammonium Phosphate)*** exports, which is the **second most used fertilizer in India after Urea**
	- In **2023-24:** India imported around **40% DAP** form **China
	- In **2024-25:** DAP imports from China were at **18%**
		- Presently, DAP imports are sourced from:
			1. **Saudi Arabia**
			2. **Morocco**
			3. **China**
	- India is handling the **rising prices and low supply of DAP** through:
		1. Diversifying import basket - importing from **Saudi Arabia** and **Morocco**
		2. India is shifting to ***20:20:0:13*** OR ***Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS)*** - now it is **India's third most consumed fertilizer***
			- **APS** has **20% Pohsphorus** and also has **13% Sulphur** which is not present in DAP
				- ***Silverlining*** as India needs **Sulphur** for **oilseeds and pulses***. Thus, increasing **APS** is good!
- **Facts about DAP:**
	- It is **highly soluble** and thus, **dissolves quickly in soil**
	- **India is the largest agricultural consumer of DAP** in the world
	- **Additional uses of DAP:**
		- *Fire retardant*
		- *Metal finishing*

	- Use of nanoparticles helps to control the release of nutrients, making them **efficient**
- **Biostimulants:** **substances** and/or **microorganisms** whose function when applied to plants or the **rhizosphere** is to **stimulate natural processes** to benefit crop quality independently of its nutrient conent.
	- **Popular biostimulants:**
		- *Humic acids, Seaweed extracts, Liquid manure composting, beneficial bacteria* and *fungi*
