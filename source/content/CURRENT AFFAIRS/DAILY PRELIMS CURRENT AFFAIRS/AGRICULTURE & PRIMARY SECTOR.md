### State of World Marine Fishery Resources 2025 Report
#GS3 #Environment #Fisheries #Report
- By **FAO**
- **Data**:
	- Only **29% of deep-sea** fish stocks are being **sustainably fished**
	- **64.5%** of all fishery stocks are **exploited within sustainable levels**, while **35.5% are overfished**
	- **>50% of migratory shark stocks** are unsustainable
	  
- **Challenges:** late maturation, slow growth, infrequent spawning, **IUU fishing**
  
- <b><u>WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies at 12th MC 2022:</u></b>
	- Bans subsidies for vessels or operators involved in IUU fishing.
	- Prohibits subsidies for fishing overfished stocks unless measures are in place to rebuild them to sustainable levels.
	- Forbids subsidies for fishing activities outside coastal state jurisdiction
	- **India's concerns:**
		- What about small scale fishermen of India? They need subsidies but they lack technical supports compared to mechanized fishermen of developed countries.
		- Apply **"Polluter pays"** and **"CBDR"** principles.
