### Location of "Missing" Ordinary Matter in the Universe
#GS3 #SciTech #Space
- Researchers detected the universe's **missing ordinary matter** using powerful **cosmic signals** known as **Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)**. Previously we have known that **at least half of the universe's ordinary/baryonic matter** was unaccounted.
- **Distribution of Baryonic(Ordinary) Matter:**
	- **76%** in the **intergalactic medium (IGM)** i.e, the *thin gas between galaxies*
	- **15%** in the **galaxy halos** - *outer regions surrounding galaxies*
	- **9%** within **galaxies** - consisting of *start, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust* all bound together by gravity
- **Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs):**
	- Are blasts of **electromagnetic radiation** in the form of **radio waves** usually emanating from the **galaxies beyond our own**
	- FRBs have duration ranging from **milliseconds** to just a **few seconds**
- **Using FRBs to locate the missing baryonic matter:**
	- FRBs act as ***"cosmic flashlights"*** and as they travel through the space:
		- They **disperse into different wavelengths**, like a prism
		- The **degree of dispersion** reveals the **amount of matter** in their **path**
	- They provided the **first direct measurement** of **matter distribution** across the cosmic web and establish themselves as a reliable **cosmological probe**
- <b><u>NOTE: Ordinary (Baryonic) Matter Vs. Dark Matter:</u></b>
	- **Baryonic matter:** includes
		- Gas, dust, starts, planets and ever day substances that **interacts with EM radiation**
		- It constitutes **15% of all matter** in the universe
		- It is composed of **Baryons** - including ***Protons & Neutrons***
	- **Dark matter:** is a mysterious substance that accounts for around **85%** of the **material universe** but remains invisible because it **doesn't interact with light**
	- Both are matter and they have **mass**, take up **space** and **exert gravitational force**

	- Increase in frequency of very hot days
	- Population density
	- % persons with disability
	- Change in land use and land cover
- <b><u>Heat wave:</u></b> As per **IMD**, heatwave is considered if **maximum temperature** of a **station** reaches **at least 40 degree C** for **plains** and **at least 30 degree C** for **Hilly** regions. The two criteria are as follows, and they have to be **met for at least 2 stations** in a Meteorological sub-division:
	- **Based on departure from normal:**
		- **Heat Wave:** Departure from the normal is **4.5 - 6.4 degree C**
		- **Severe Heat Wave:** Departure from the normal is **>6.4 degree C**
	- **Based on actual maximum temperature:
		- **Heat Wave:** When actual temperature **>=45 degree C**
		- **Severe Heat Wave:** When actual temperature **>=47 degree C**
- <b><u>Heat  risk:</u></b> is ***probability* of experiencing heat-related illness or death due to exposure to extreme temperatures**. As per **CEEW**, it depends on 3 crucial factors:
	1. **Intensity of heat:** and its compounding effects like *humidity*
	2. **Degree of exposure**
	3. **Underlying vulnerabilities of affected communities**

### Global Ocean Darkening
#GS3 #Environment 
- #Data #MainsValueAddition Recent study found out that **21% of the global ocean had become darker** between 2003 and 2022, especially in the Arctic, Antarctic, and the Gulf Stream.
- **Darkening of the Ocean:**
	- It refers to **reduction in light penetration** into the global oceans, **shrinking the photic zone**
		- **Photic zone:** is the **sunlit layer**(~200m) where most **90% marine life** thrives
- **Reasons for Ocean darkening:**
	- Due to **ecological shifts** and,
	- **Phytoplankton & zooplankton blooms**
	- **Specific reasons:
		- In **coastal oceans:**
			- Combination of *nutrient, organic material and sedimentation loading* near the coast, caused by:
				- *Agricultural runoff*
				- *Increased rainfall*
		- In **open oceans:**
				- Driven by *warming of the surface oceans* leading to *algal bloom*
			- *Climate driven* changes in *ocean circulation patterns*
- **Impact of the Ocean Darkening:**
	- On **marine ecology and productivity:** ocean darkening **limits light-dependent processes** such as *growth, communication, reproduction, photosynthesis, etc.* thus, limiting ocean productivity
	- **Fisheries industry:** *fish stocks decline* due to **habitat compression** and **disrupted reproductive cycles**
	- **Regulation of climate:** hampers **carbon absorption** and **oxygen production**

### Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
#GS1 #Geography #OceanCurrents #Environment #ClimateChange 
- A recent study found out that under moderate emissions, **global warming may not be enough to offset the cooling** caused by a potential collapse of the AMOC
- **AMOC:**
	- A system of ocean currents that **circulates water within the Atlantic Ocean, bringing warm water North and cold water South**
	<p align="center">
	<img src="https://globalchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMOC-graphic-Oceanography-2-1024x487.jpg" alt="AMOC" width="500"/>
	</p>

	- **Mechanism of AMOC:** based on **temperature and salinity differences:**
		- ***Warm surface water moves towards poles*** and cools down
		- As sea ice forms, it leaves behind salt, making surrounding water denser
		- ***Dense cool water sinks and flows southward*** at ***deep ocean levels***
		- This **deep water eventually rises** again through upwelling, warms up, and restarts the cycle
- **Significance of AMOC:**
	- AMOC is a part of a, **"global conveyor belt"** of ocean currents, exchanging cool and warm water
	- AMOC helps **distribute heat, moisture, and nutrients** across oceans over long periods of time
	- **Carbon sequestration** as carbon rich nutrients go deep into the ocean ad remain for decades
- **Reasons for weakening of AMOC:** ***Climate Change***
	- Melting of ice adds cold, fresh water to north Atlantic, therby reducing water's salinity and density
	- The dense water becomes scarce, weakening the AMOC
- **Impact of AMOC weakening:** ***Climate tipping point***
	- **Climate disruptions:** even with a slight weakening of the AMOC
		- **Cool Europe** and changes in **precipitation patterns** of Europe, South America and Africa
		- Affect the **timing of Indian monsson**
		- Lead the **tropical rain belt to shift southwards**, resulting in **droughts over African Sahel**
	- **Threat to ocean life:** as fewer nutrients reaches the surface harming the marine food chains

### "India's Data Imperative: The Pivot Towards Quality" Report
#GS2 #GS3 #Governance #SciTech #DataGovernance #Report 
- **NITI Aayog** released the report titled, **"India's Data Imperative: The Pivot Towards Quality"*** highlighting that over past decade, India has emerged as a ***global leader in digital public infrastructure***.
- India now enters the **next phase of its digital journey** - the focus must shift from **merely scaling** to **prioritizing quality data**
	- **Quality data** consists of **6 core attributes:**
		- ***Accuracy, Completeness, Timeliness, Consistency, Validity, and Uniqueness***
- The report introduces a ***Data-Quality Scorecard*** to monitor and improve datasets, as well as a ***Data-Quality Maturity Framework*** having **7 dimensions** and **5 levels of maturities:**

	2. *Standards & Metadata*
	3. *Data Capture & Validation Controls*
	4. *Quality Monitoring & Reporting*
	5. *Standards & Metadata*
	6. *Data Capture & Validation Controls*
	7. *Quality Monitoring & Reporting*
- **Need of Quality Data for Governance:**
	- **Fortify digital governance:** powering efficient digital platforms, such as UPI and Aadhar, and ensures the smoother delivery of government services

- **Challenges in leveraging quality data for governance:**
	- **Faulty data capture:** field programs prioritize **speed over correctness**, resulting in a culture where, *80% accuracy is considered "good enough*.
	- **Fragmented Data storage:** some systems utilize *modern cloud tools*, but any rely on *outdated databases* that lack audit trails and a standardized structure
	- **Inconsistent Data sharing:** different departments employ varying formats and update schedules, resulting in *slow and expensive data integration.*
	- **Poor archival practices:** old, outdated records are rarely removes, cluttering systems and slowing performance
