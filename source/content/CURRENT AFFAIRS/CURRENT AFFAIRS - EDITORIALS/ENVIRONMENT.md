### **RAJKOT'S MODEL FOR DUMPSITE REMEDIATION**
#GS3 #Environment #WasteManagment #MainsValueAddition  
- Rajkot turned **Nakarwadi**, a decade old dumpsite with **16lakh Tn** of **legacy waste** into a **20 acre green urban forest**, as a part of **Swachh Bharat Mission's "Lakshya Zero Dumpsite"** initiative to develop **"Garbage Free Cities"**  
- **Rajkot's model:**  
	- **Miyawaki technique** and using **secondary treated water for irrigation**  
	- **Waste-to-energy** technique with **bioremediation**  
	- Developing a healthy **circular economy**

### **ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WARS**
#GS3 #Environment #InternalSecurity #IR #convention #MainsValueAddition 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- The conflict in the industrialized **eastern Ukraine**, with power plants, chemical factories, and old mines, **risked releasing toxic pollutants** 

<b><u>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WARS/CONFLICTS:</u></b>
- **GHG emission:** Global **militaries** contribute around **5.5%** worldwide emissions
- **Pollution and contamination:**
	- In **Ukraine**, landmines and unexploded ordnance pose long-term risks and the **cleanup may cost USD 34.6 Billion**
- **Resource depletion and biodiversity loss:** wars drive deforestation, disrupt agriculture resulting into habitat lost
	- #Eg In the **Vietnam war** - widespread use of **herbicides** like ***Agent Orange*** resulted in **defoliation of forest areas**

<b><u>International Agreements:</u></b> #convention #MainsValueAddition 
- ***Paris Agreement, 2015:*** It made **reporting of military emissions** ***voluntary***
- ***Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998:*** describes widespread, long-term and sever damage to environment during international armed conflicts
	- India is **NOT** a member
- ***Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD):*** prohibits use of environmental modification techniques like *weather manipulation*
	- India is a **party**

### **EMERGING CLIMATE RISKS**
#GS3 #Environment #ClimateChange 

<b><u>NEWSL</u></b>
- **UNEP** released, ***Frontiers 2025: The Weight of Time Report*** highlighting emerging environmental issues before they escalate into global or regional crises.

<b><u>MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED BY UNEP:</u></b>
1. **Reactivation of microbes in warming cryosphere:** climate change could reactivate and **remobilize dormant microbes** into new environments potentially,
	- **Altering microbial communities**,
	- Introducing pathogens, or causing biodiversity loss
		> Microbes that thrive under extremely challenging habitats like frozen environments are referred to as ***Psychrophiles***

2. **River barriers:** all barriers (*dams, wier or low-head dam, barrage, culvers, sluices, etc.*) affect the **river ecosystem**
	- **Impact of river barriers:** 
		- Modify water flow and temperature, habitat
		- Quality and quantity of downstream sediment transport, 
		- Displace indigenous community and fish movement.
	- **Report recognizes "barrier removals" as an accepted strategy to restore river health**
		- **Barrier removal** reduce ***river fragmentation*** and **restore connectivity** in the river ecosystem.
			- Around **89% of global river volume** are affected by **river fragmentation**
3. **Demographic challenge:** climate change is exacerbating **environmental risks** such as *heatwaves, air pollution, and floods* which **disproportionately threaten increasing population of older adults**
4. **Remobilization of legacy pollutants by flood events:** ***Persistant contaminents*** (Heavy metal, Organic compounds, etc.) in water and sediment can,
	- ***Bioaccumulate:*** Enter and accumulate in plants and animals, and 
	- ***Biomagnify:*** Subsequently contaminate food chains with increased concentrations in higher trophic levels.
