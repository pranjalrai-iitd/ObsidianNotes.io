### CROP DIVERSIFICATION CHALLENGES IN PUNJAB
#GS3 #Agriculture #Environment 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> Despite Punjab government's **pilot project** to **divert 12K Ha** from **Paddy** to **Maize** and to increase **cotton cultivation by 15%**, the state saw an all-time-high of **32.44LHa under paddy**.
- **35-36 Lakh Ha** under cultivation in Punjab during the Kharif season
- **91% of Kharif** area is under Paddy 

<b><u>CHALLENGES:</u></b>
1. Growing the same crops year after year on the same land **increases vulnerability to pest and disease** attacks
2. Paddy cultivation specifically **depletes soil** which **increases dependence of chemical feritlisers**
3. Paddy is a **water guzzling crop** and leads to **GW table reduction**
	- Punjab's GW table has been declining by **0.5m per annum** on average
4. **Farmer's propensity to deny work around government mandates:** for instance the **Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009** *barred* any *nursery-sowing before May 15* and *transplanting before June 15*. However, farmers **pushed the cropping cycle back**, **shortening the window** between the Kharif harvest and sowing of wheat, leading to **stubble burning** problem.
5. **Unintended consequences of MSP:** MSP procurement is skewed in favor of Punjab and makes paddy attractive while alternatives are ignored by farmers.
6. **Flawed policy making and freebies:** like **8-hours free electricity** have increased GW depletion. Similar is the case for **subsidies on fertilizers**.

<b><u>QUOTE:</u></b> ***Agriculture is back-bone of Indian economy and Indian agriculture growth is monsoon dependent. This dependence is so significant that the popular magazine Down to Earth once quipped "<b><i><u>the monsoon is the chief finance minister of India</u></i></b>"***.
