### INDIA'S GARMENTS SECTOR: Textiles & Apparels
#GS3 #Textiles

<u><b>DATA</b></u>:
- Employs **45 million** people and & contributes to **2.3% of GDP**. However, the share in **global trade** is **4.2%**.
- **Current apparel exports: $15.7 billion**
- **Export target in apparels: $40 billion by 2030**

<u><b>SCOPE:</b></u>
- **Semi-skilled** and **labor-intensive** sector: a worker can be trained to operate a sewing machine in 60 days.
- **Export potential**: $40 billion target for 2030
- leads to **Women empowerment**, as high share of women labour participation.

<u><b>ISSUES</b></u>:
1. **Low and stagnant exports**: for last 2 decades the growth is **stagnant** and in last few years, **-2% AAGR**.
2. **Lack of scale**: **80%** of India's apparel units are **MSMEs**. They are **"too many, too small and too dispersed"**.
3. **High cost of capital**: **9% in India** compared to **3-3.5% in China**. This is couples with **low-margins of 4.5%**, in the sector.
4. **Labour cost**: **30%** of the garment production cost. This **restricts formalization**, as costs further increase with labour codes.

<u><b>BEST PRACTICES/GLOBAL EXAMPLES</b></u>:
1. **Integrated production systems** with large scale export oriented factories of **China** and **Vietnam**.
2. **Single-window "buying houses"** of **Bangladesh** for bulk export orders.
3. **Shahi Exports of India, <i>"Sarla's garment miracle"</i>**: Started with a 15 member team in 1974, now >50 factories and >1 lakh workers with 70% women.

<u><b>WAY FORWARD</b></u>:
 1. **Capital subsidy** of **20-25%** linked to the size of the unit.
 2. A **5 year tax holiday** to reach the $40 Bn target.
 3. Link **MGRNEGA funds**, to reduce cost of labour.
 4. Promote schemes like **SAMARTH** with focus on skilling women.
 5. 2/7 **PM-MITRA**, parks must be designed as **garment focused hubs** especially in UP, which has the highest number of fragmented garment industries.
 6. **Export linked incentives(ELI)** scheme.

<u><b>CONCLUSION/OUOTE</b></u>: 
<b><i>"Garment industry sits at the intersection of mass employment and maximum value addition. They also promote down-stream logistics and exports along with empowerment of women."</i></b>
