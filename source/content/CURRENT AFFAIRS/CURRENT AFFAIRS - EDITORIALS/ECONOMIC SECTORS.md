### **INDIA'S GARMENTS SECTOR: Textiles & Apparels**
#GS3 #Textiles

<u><b>DATA</b></u>:
- Employs **45 million** people and & contributes to **2.3% of GDP**. However, the share in **global trade** is **4.2%**.
- **Current apparel exports: $15.7 billion**
- **Export target in apparels: $40 billion by 2030**

<u><b>SCOPE:</b></u>
- **Semi-skilled** and **labor-intensive** sector: a worker can be trained to operate a sewing machine in 60 days.
- **Export potential**: $40 billion target for 2030
- leads to **Women empowerment**, as high share of women labour participation.

<u><b>ISSUES</b></u>:
1. **Low and stagnant exports**: for last 2 decades the growth is **stagnant** and in last few years, **-2% AAGR**.
2. **Lack of scale**: **80%** of India's apparel units are **MSMEs**. They are **"too many, too small and too dispersed"**.
3. **High cost of capital**: **9% in India** compared to **3-3.5% in China**. This is couples with **low-margins of 4.5%**, in the sector.
4. **Labour cost**: **30%** of the garment production cost. This **restricts formalization**, as costs further increase with labour codes.

<u><b>BEST PRACTICES/GLOBAL EXAMPLES</b></u>:
1. **Integrated production systems** with large scale export oriented factories of **China** and **Vietnam**.
2. **Single-window "buying houses"** of **Bangladesh** for bulk export orders.
3. **Shahi Exports of India, <i>"Sarla's garment miracle"</i>**: Started with a 15 member team in 1974, now >50 factories and >1 lakh workers with 70% women.

<u><b>WAY FORWARD</b></u>:
 1. **Capital subsidy** of **20-25%** linked to the size of the unit.
 2. A **5 year tax holiday** to reach the $40 Bn target.
 3. Link **MGRNEGA funds**, to reduce cost of labour.
 4. Promote schemes like **SAMARTH** with focus on skilling women.
 5. 2/7 **PM-MITRA**, parks must be designed as **garment focused hubs** especially in UP, which has the highest number of fragmented garment industries.
 6. **Export linked incentives(ELI)** scheme.

<u><b>CONCLUSION/OUOTE</b></u>: 
<b><i>"Garment industry sits at the intersection of mass employment and maximum value addition. They also promote down-stream logistics and exports along with empowerment of women."</i></b>

### **CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN INDIA**
#GS3 #Economy #Industries #Chemicals #Report

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **NITI Aayog** released ***"Chemical Industry: Powering India's Participation in Global Value Chains"*** report providing an extensive analysis of India's chemical sector

<b><u>HIGHLIGHTS OF NITI REPORT:</u></b> #Data 
- Currently, **India's share** in GVC (Global Value Chains) in **3.5%**
- ***India being the 6th largest chemicals producer globally***
- Highlighted that fiscal and non-fiscal interventions will lead to a **USD 1 Trillion** ***chemical industry*** and achieve **12% GVC share by 2040**

<b><u>CHALLENGES OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRY:</b></u>
1. **Heavy reliance on imported feed-stock:** this contributed to a **USD 31 Billion** ***trade-deficit***, stemming from ***limited domestic backward integration.***
2. **Low investment in R&D:** 0.7% against the global average of 2.3% in R&D hampers indigenous innovation in high-value chemicals
3. **Skill shortage:** Chemical industry has a ***30% shortfall in skilled professionals***
4. **Safety issues** and lack of **preparedness against chemical disasters:***
	- #Eg ***Vishakhapatnam gas leak (2020)*** - ***Styrene*** leak from **LG Polymers**
	- #Eg ***Bhopal gas tragedy (1984)*** - ***Methyl IsoCynate*** leak from **Union Carbide** pesticide plant
	- #Eg ***Telangana factory explosion (2025)*** - ***Microcrystalline Cellulose (MC)*** manufactured in un-safe environment at **Sigachi Industries**
5. **Other challenges:**
	- *Infrastructure limitations*
	- *Logical inefficiencies*
	- *Complex regulatory frameworks*

<b><u>WAY AHEAD:</u></b>
1. Targeted government support such as **Viability Gap Funding (VGF)** to catalyze Funding and attract FDI in the Chemical industry sector
2. Establish world-class **chemicals hub** in India and introduce ***opex (operational expenditure) subsidy*** for chemicals with high import dependence, export potential, and end-market critically
3. **fast-track environmental clearance** and **securing FTAs** to support Industrial growth.
4. Build **safety awareness** and **risk assessments** through ***comprehensive safety audits*** supplemented by **IoT** based **SCADA** systems and **digital twins** to build ***smart chemical industries.***
