### **REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: MATERNITY BENEFITS**
#GS2 #GS1 #VulnerableSections #Women 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> May, 2025 Supreme court set aside a Madras HC order that had denied maternity leave to a government school teacher for the birth for her third child. The court ruled that, 
>***"maternity leave is part of a woman's reproductive rights and requires constitutional protection".***

<b><u>REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE:</u></b>
- **ILO's Maternity Protection Convention, 1919:** #convention calling for 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, free medical care during and after pregnancy, job guarantees upon return to work.
- **Maternity Benefit Act, 1929:** drafted by **BR Ambedkar, NM Joshi & MK Dixit** - introduced in Bombay Legislative Council.
- **Maternity Benefit Act, 1961:** 
	- Regulated employment of women in various sectors (including government, private etc. with **$\mathbf{\geq 10}$ employees**) **before & after childbirth**.
	- Grants **12 weeks of paid maternity leave**
- **2017 Amendment to Maternity Benefit Act, 1961:** 
	- Mandated by **2000 ILO Maternity Benefit Convention** #convention 
	- Extended **maternity leave** to **26 weeks**
	- Facilitated establishment of **childcare facilities** like creches in workplaces with **$\mathbf{\geq 50}$ employees**, with right of the mothers to visit creches during the day.
- **Sweden's model:** 1st country to introduce **paid parental leave** to **both parents** - as a gender neutral policy.

**CONCERNS:** 
1. Lack of clarity on the responsibility to pay for maternity leave - weather **state** or the **employer**.
	- Reflected in the low **FLFPR = 37% (2022-2023)**
2. **Gender discrimination:** the ***India Discrimination Report 2022*** by **Oxfam India** suggests that gender discrimination is the reason for **98%** of the **employment gap**.
	- This is because of the prejudice against the **care-giving & household responsibilities** of women.
	- Even, the Maternity Benefit Act led to unintended consequences where employers favored hiring males to reduce the compliance cost with the Act.
3. Maternity Benefit Act, 2017 applies only to **formal sector** and awareness about the provisions is also low, leading to compliance failure particularly regarding the creche facilities.
4. Work from home is allowed as per law, after the maternity period. However, it is left to employers discretion - rights thus are dependent on the employer.

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b> 
1. **Extending** the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act to the **informal sector**, as majority of women are from marginalized sections. This can be supported by state support.
2. **Private sector** needs to be more **compliant** - build creche facilities and no arbitrary denial or termination of permanent/contractual employees on maternity leaves.
3. Extension of the act to **contractual employees**.
4. Comprehensive **Paternity leave law** or a **family leave policy** needed in India, for both parents.

### **URBANISATION: SUSTAINABLE & COST-EFFECTIVE TRANSIT SOLUTION**
#GS1 #GS3 #Urbanisation #Mobility

<b><u>DATA/INTRO:</u></b> 
- Over **60%** of India's population would move from low-productive rural India to highly productive urban India by **2060**. 
- While policymakers have plans to construct smart cities, unlike China, **not many new emerging smart cities are coming of age**. In contrast, the **metros/existing tier-1 cities are on an ever-expanding spree**, making **transportation** a major challenge due to increasing **demand**.
- India achieved **1,000 Km of metro network**, making India home to world's **3rd largest metro network**.

<b><u>GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES:</u></b>
1. **PM e-Bus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism** announced in **Budget 2025** with aim of improving urban bus transportation with ~10,000 urban buses.
2. **PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM e-DRIVE):** to support procurement of 14,000 new e-buses, 1,10,000 e-rickshaws, e-trucks, and e-ambulances.

<b><u>CHALLENGES REGARDING URBAN TRANSIT</u></b>:
1. India needs **2,00,000 urban buses** but only **35,000** are operational including e-buses, under various Government initiatives.
2. <b><u>Economic Survey 2025:</u></b> Only **37%** of the **urban residents** have easy **access to public transportation**. Far behind Brazil and China, with more than 50%.
3. Development of a **metro** network is **long-term and a costly venture**. Most have been developed by Central funding and are still to recover their total costs. 
	- Projected ridership is still to be matched in almost all metros.
	- Users are extremely *fare sensitive* - a fare rise leads to reduced footfalls.

<b><u>ALTERNATIVES:</u></b> 
1. Cost-effective, **road-based transport** for better **last-mile connectivity**.
2. Attracting **private investment**, which remains limited due to uncertain returns.
3. Focus on **bottom-up transport models** - **trams** and **trolley-buses** can outperform e-buses in financial terms.
	- **Trams** show a **45% long-term profitability over 7 decades**, their usual life cycle. They also offer scalability and are aligned with climate goals.
	- **e-Buses** show a **82% net-loss over 7 decades**, due to high operational and replacement costs.
4. New fast mobility solutions to **decongest** the metropolitan cities - on the model of **Namo Bharat (RRTS)**.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> 
>***"Reviving the past Trams is not just a nostalgic choice -  it is a smart and timely move toward a more sustainable and financially viable transport future".***

### **CITIES AS FUTURE OF INDIA - CHALLENGES AND WAY FORWARD**
#GS1 #GS3 #Society #Economy #Urbanisation #Governance #Data 

<b><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></b>
>***The next decade will be an "urban decade", and India's 15 cities (urban hubs) which currently contribute 30% to its GDP will drive it's ability to become a USD 30 Trillion+ economy by 2047, facilitating an extra 1.5% growth*** - Amitabh kant
- These **15 cities** that contribute to **India's 30% GDP** are - *Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Coimbatore, Noida/Greater Noida, Kochi, Gurugram, Vishakhapatnam, and Nagpur* 
- While cities like *Bangkok, London, Dubai, and Singapore* attract millions worldwide, Indian cities rarely feature as **global destinations**

<b><u>CHALLENGES FACED BY INDIAN CITIES:</b></u> 
>***All these challenges are a direct reflection of how these cities expanded without proper planning or strong urban governance.*** - Amitabh Kant

1. <b><u>Air pollution:</u></b> 
	- #Data Approximately ***42 of the 50 most polluted cities*** are in India
	- **CAUSES:** Vehicular emissions, construction and biomass burning
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. **Electrification** of the **public transport** at the earliest
		2. Strict implementation of **construction dust norms**
		3. The **Budget FY26** announced the creation of a ***Rs. 1 lakh crore - Urban Challenge Fund*** - this can include **city-level grand challenges.**
		4. **Performance appraisal and competitive finance:** cities should be **ranked** and **financial incentives** should be disbersed based on performance.
2. <b><u>Solid Waste Management:</u></b>
	- #Data  
		- ***AT CITY LEVEL:*** As per **MoHUA** our cities produce more than ***1,50,000 tonnes*** of **solid waste daily**, of which only **25%** is **processed scientifically and sustainably**
		- ***AT NATIONAL LEVEL:*** India generates about ***62 MnTn*** of **municipal  waste annually**, of which about ***70% is collected*** but only ***30% is processed***.
		- ***POTENTIAL:*** As per some experts, **sustainable, circular system** can unlock as much as ***USD 73.5 Trillion annually by 2030***
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. Building **strong waste collection and processing infrastructure:**
			- Purchasing **vehicles** for **waste collection** and **transportation**
			- **Training of staff** to handle tasks effectively
		2. Clear policies and regulations that promote **performance-based accountability**
		3. **Community involvement** is the key to transform waste management into a **sustainable, circular system***
		4. #MainsValueAddition ***INDORE'S MODEL*** can be emulated in other cities: 
			- **Door-to-door segregation** of waste followed by transportation in **specialized vehicles** to world-class **waste processing plants**, while **wet waste** being processed into **BioCNG**.
		5. #MainsValueAddition ***RAJKOT's MODEL*** can be emulated for addressing **legacy waste** - it is focused on using **Miyawaki technique** with **Bioremediation** to reclaim and address legacy waste dumping sites, while promoting **circular economy** to reduce accumulation of waste at the site.
3. <b><u>Water Stress:</u></b>
	- #Data 
		- On ***RIVER POLLUTION:*** Nearly **half** of our **rivers** are **polluted**
		- On ***WATER SCARCITY:*** In 2018, NITI Aayog predicted that ***40% of India's population would face water scarcity by 2030***
		- On ***WATER WASTAGE:*** Cities lose ***40-50% of piped waters*** in **transmission**
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		- ***INDORE'S MODEL:*** #MainsValueAddition ***"India's first water surplus city"***
			1. **Sewage leaks into water bodies** were **plugged using GIS technology**
			2. **Rainwater harvesting** and **reuse** of treated water 
4. <b><u>Lack of affordable housing and proliferation of informal settlements:</u></b>
	- #Data 
		- The CII and Knight Frank estimate a **shortfall of** ***10 million affordable homes***, expected to ***triple to 31 million by 2030***
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. Increasing **floor space index (FSI)** and **floor area ratio (FAR)**  to promote **vertical growth** 
		2. **Density-related incentives** as highlighted by ***G20 India*** and *OECD* report on *"Financing cities of Tomorrow"* - this can lead to **higher development densities** and effective **land use**
			- #Eg ***Density Bonuses*** - allow developers to build more unit of space
			- #Eg ***Land Value Capture (LVC)*** - capture a portion of the increased land value that results from public investments
5. <b><u>Traffic congestion:</u></b>
	- #Data 
		- According to BCG, the **average Indian city dweller** spends ***1.5-2 hours daily stuck in traffic***.
	- Traffic congestion also **boosts emissions** and **pollution**
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. Investments in **public transports** and **high speed urban mobility** solutions like **Namo Bharat** trains to de-congest metropolitan cities
		2. Implementing **congestion-based pricing** and harnessing **AI** and **IoT** for ***smart traffic management*** can optimize flow
		3. Citizens must develop a culture of **responsible driving** and must **adhere to the traffic rules**, only then the roads will be free
6. <b><u>Digital infrastructure and internet speeds:</u></b>
	- #Data 
		- While cities like *Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong* offer **internet speeds exceeding 1 Gbps**, ***India's average mobile internet speed is just 100mbps***
	- **High speed internet** and **digital infrastructure** is critical to attract top global companies to set up **R&D hubs** and **Global Capability Centers (GCCs)**
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. Expand **high-speed broadband**, **4G and 5G** across cities and rural areas - where inaccessible areas  can be connected through **satellite based broadband**
		2. Cutting **spectrum prices** to attract investment
		3. Building **extensive fibre-optic network** and deploying **5G nationally**
7. <b><u>Lack of decentralized planning, governance and financing:</u></b>
	- #Data 
		- **NITI Aayog** reports that ***India has just one planner for every 1 lakh people***, while **developed** nations have **one for every 5,000-10,000.**
		- **Property tax collection** is less than **0.2% of GDP**
	- **WAY FORWARD:**
		1. Full implementation of **74th CAA** and **ULBs** must be empowered
		2. Increasing **property tax collection** using technology 
		3. **Digitisation of land records** and exploring ***Land Value Capture (LVC*)** as means to generate revenue
		4. Cities can also tap into ***municipal bond markets*** and use ***blended finance***
		5. These are effective ***only after completing planning and governance reforms***

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b>
>***Our cities carry centuries of history and should be world-class economic and cultural magnets. The above steps must be paired with investments in Walkable Heritage Zones (WHZs) and seamless urban experiences - which government enables, and the private sector creates.*** - Amitabh kant

### **INTER-GENERATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS : Silver/Geriatric Economy**
#GS1 #Society #Demography #Elders 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> **Generational Gap Perception Index** reveals **disconnection** between the youth and elder population shaped by *education, dependence, & emotional distance* then age alone.

<b><u>REASONS FOR DISCONNECT:</u></b>
1. **Differing perceptions among Youth and Elders on various parameters:**

| **PARAMETERS**            | **PERCEPTION OF YOUTH**                                                  | **PERCEPTION OF ELDERS**                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perception Gap**        | Youth associate elders with **wisdom**                                   | Elders feel **emotional neglect** and **loss of autonomy**          |
| **Digital Divide**        | Youth feels that elders are **disintegrated** in learning digital skills | Elders feel the youth are **impatient** and offer fast explanations |
| **Family Vs Formal Care** | Increased inclination towards **paid caregivers**                        | **Family** as the primary support system                            |
| **Aspirations for Aging** | **Independent living** near family or with retirement communities        | **Family** based living in old age                                  |
2. **Communication barriers:** Both **elders (76%)** and **youth (74%)** identify **busy youth schedules** as the top barrier to interaction.
3. **Disparity in comfort levels of inter-generational communications by topic:**
	- *Life advice* - both groups moderately comfortable
	- *Career plans* - both groups least comfortable

<b><u>Measures to foster effective inter-genational communications:</u></b>
1. **Aging sensitization:** to be included in school/college curriculum to foster empathy among youth regarding *emotional realities of aging*.
2. **Youth-led training initiatives:** establishing ***"Digital Buddy"*** programs to pair tech-savvy youth with elders for patient digital learning.
3. **Community-based elder support centers:** offering holistic geriatric care including emotional counselling, etc.
4. **Inter-generational *"Wisdom Exchange"* programs**.
5. ***"Time bank"*** scheme of **Switzerland:** where youth earn time credits by providing services (like repairing, lawn mowing, babysitting) to elders, which can be exchanged for services when they need assistance themselves.

### **CENSUS**
#GS1 #Demography #Census

<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b> Population census is part of the **Union list of the VII schedule**. It is an exercise which **enumerates details of all Indians** including their **age, gender, family status, economic status, unemployment, language, disability, migration**, etc.

<b><u>FACTS ABOUT CENSUS:</u></b>
- <b><u>Legal provisions:</u></b> under the provisions of ***Census Act, 1948*** and ***Census Rules, 1990***
- <b><u>Census 2011:</u></b> conducted in 2-phases with various reference dates
	1. *Phase 1:* *"House Listing"*
	2. *Phase 2:* "*Population Enumeration (PE)*"
- <b><u>Proposed Census 2027:</u></b> will be conducted again in **2 phases** along with **enumeration of caste**:
	- *Phase 1: "House Listing"* in **2026**
	- *Phase 2: "Population Enumeration"* in **Feb 2027**
	- **Reference date** will be ***00:00 hrs*** of <b><u><i>1st March 2027</i></u></b>
		- For **UT of Ladakh** and *non-synchronous snow bound areas of* **UT of J&K** and the states of **Uttarakhand** and **Himachal Pradesh**, the **Reference date** will be ***00:00 hrs*** of ***1st Oct 2027***
	- It will be India's **1st digital census** conducted through mobile apps available in *16 languages* (Hindi + Eng + 14 regional).
	- It will also be the **1st census in Independent India** to include **enumeration of caste** as well.
- <b><u>Details of the Notified Census 2027:</u></b>
	- The two phases with details are:
		1. **House-listing phase:** enumerators collect data on the head of the HH, the number of members, use of the building, material of construction, number of rooms, ownership status, sources of water & electricity, type of toilet, assets like TV, phone etc.
		2. **Population enumeration:** focuses on individual data - age, sex, DoB, education, occupation, religion, caste/tribe, disability status etc.
	- It will allow **self-enumeration** for the first time and offers nearly **real-time monitoring**
	- The **Census Managmeent and Monitoring System (CMMS)** will allow supervision and resolution of field issues without delay
	- Around **30 lakh enumerators**, primarily **school teachers** are to be deployed in addition to **1.2 Lakh functionaries** at district and sub-district levels and **46K trainers**  
	- <b><u>Changes in Process and Technology:</u></b>
		1. **Self-enumeration**
		2. **GPS integration:** while 2011 used physical maps. This time there will be **GPS tagging** and **geo-fencing** to avoid coverage gaps
		3. **Mobile tracking and validation**: real-time alerts and error correction
		4. **Coding system:** The **Registrar General of India**, has introduced a new coding system to make data collection more accurate.
		5. **New questions in 2027 Census questionnaire** for higher granularity of the collected data

<b><u>IMPORTANCE OF CENSUS:</u></b>
- **Economic significance:**
	1. **Statistical data** provided by census is used as various **policy inputs** and will act as **statistical basis for all other surveys**. Surveys cannot match the accuracy of census
		- ***Eg:*** #Eg *CPI weights* can be better revised by understanding how much people actually spend on food
	2. **Understanding migration:** migration pattern has undergone a huge shift from 2011
	3. Measuring extent of **urbanization**: current models are based on 2011 census data but, needs update.
		- ***Eg:*** #Eg *Hauz Khas*, an affluent urban area in South Delhi, was *partially designated as rural in 2011*
- **Social significance:**
	1. Understanding **health, education & income status** of different communities is crucial for quantifying and fighting **inequality** in society.
	2. **Better identification of disadvantage groups:** The **Caste Census** can help design better targeted schemes and can enable effective inclusive measures.
- **Political significance:**
	1. **Vertical devolution by Finance Commission:** can consider latest population data
	2. **Delimitation exercise:** as per **Article 82**, delimitation follows census and will enable re-drawl of boundaries
	3. **Women reservation:** 33% reservation will come into effect only after the Census
- **Effective global comparison:** better tracking of socioeconomic-indicators and performance against international goals like SDG.

<b><u>CONCERNS:</u></b>
1. **Delay of six years:** reduces comparability with previous census
2. **Politicized issue:** politicization of delimitation and caste census may lead to misrepresentation by vested interests
3. **Privacy issues:** digital data collection comes with vulnerability associated with cyber crimes

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> 
>***"Census provides a critical reset to economy and its policy makers along with its citizens."***

### **DIGITAL COLONIALISM**
#GS1 #GS3 #SocialIssues #SciTech #Data 

<b><u>NEWS/ DEFINITION:</u></b>  Vice Presidents's statement on **Data Colonialism**
>***"Nations will no longer be compromised or colonized by armies as armies have been replaced by algorithms. Sovereignty will not be lost through invasions, but through dependence on foreign digital infrastructure"*** - VP

<b><u>DIGITAL COLONIALISM:</u></b>
- #Definition **Data colonialism** refers to a phenomenon where *developed nations and their big tech companies utilize digital platforms to control and profit from less developed nations*.
	- It is a form of ***neo-colonialism of Global South***
- **Digital Data** is benefiting **Global North** in the following ways:
	- Analyzing behavior, resulting in *heightened competitive edge* in **economic and political arenas**
	- **Advancing AI** with *development* and *hardware* primarily controlled by Global North
	- **Data Monetization** - people and companies of Global north sell data collected from users of Global South
- #Eg US-based companies like *Google* and *Amazon* collect data from developing nations to reshape various industries

<b><u>CONCERNS:</u></b>
1. **Loss of digital sovereignty:** developed nations and tech giants set global digital rules
	 #Eg In 2024, **WhatsApp** threatened to exit India over traceability clause of the *2021 IT Rules.* 
2. **Cultural imperialism:** through **social media** and **search engines** often pushing the worldview of developed countries and marginalizing local cultures.
3. **Surveillance capitalism:** companies collect **vast personal data** without consent, violating privacy and civil rights.

<b><u>WAYS FOR TACKLING DIGITAL COLONIALISM:</u></b>
1. **Enhance digital sovereignty:** build **indigenous digital systems** like *ONDC* and ***India Stack***
2. **Enforce data localisation:** India's key initiative in this direction is **boycotting** the ***Osaka Track*** on data flows and enactment of the **DPDP Act, 2023**
3. **Reduce import dependencies:** focus on local production in critical areas like defence, space and science through initiatives like *Make in India* and ***Chips to Startup (C2S) program***.
4. **Update policy:** The **UNCTAD 2021** report urged countries to **regularly review data flow policies** to balance economic growth, public interest and connected global digital ecosystem.
