### **GDP BASE YEAR REVISION**
#GS3 #Economy #GDP 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- The current **GDP base year** is planned to be revised to **2022-2023** and the revised series of data will be released from February, 2026. The same will be accompanied with revision of base year for **IIP** to **2022-23** and **CPI** also to **2022-2023**.
- **First set of GDP estimates:** compiled by **National Income Committee** under **PC Mahalanobis** in 1949. Since, then **CSO** undertook GDP calculation and till present, **7 base year revisions** have been carried out, most recent being in 2015.

<b><u>RATIONALE BEHIND GDP BASE YEAR REVISION:</u></b>
1. To **accurately understand and report the state of the real economy**. Most recent price-levels offer better insight into relative GDP growth. 
2. To **capture the fundamental changes in the economy** - the era of quick-commerce, ed. tech. needs to be considered as a part of the base to accurately judge the future growth of GDP.
3. **New data sources and workforce estimates** for the unorganized/informal sector need to be accounted by revising the base year, as economy formalizes.
	- CSO was using NSSO survey, which was carried out every 5 years. Thus, revision must ideally be every 5 years.
	- Now, with **HCES** and proposed **updates to the PLFS**, right time to update the GDP base year.
4. India is on **cusp** of becoming the **3rd largest economy** and there are **concerns** about **India's GDP calculation method** - many experts have expressed that India's GDP measurements are overstated along with various data quality issues.
5. Revision can be coupled with other **data reforms** like **PPI instead of WPI** while trying to improve the estimate accuracies.

<b><u>WHY BASE YEAR NOT CHANGED IN 2017-18?:</u></b> ***"Missed cycle in 2017-18"***
1. The **HCES** and **PLFS**, on which the revision was based, ran into trouble with **government itself raising data quality issues**.
2. As per the government, **2017-18** were **"abnormal"** years due to the earlier **demonetization (2016)** and **GST (2017)**.
3. Further, **COVID-19** pandemic plagued the later years.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> A concern however, is that the year of 2022-23 witnessed **pentup-demand** post the **COIVD-19** pandemic. This could lead to the new estimates being lower than expected. Though, update is required in conformity with the **UN-SMA** accounting methods.

### **FORMAL STAFFING INDUSTRY**
#GS3 #Economy #Employment 

<b><u>BACKGROUND:</u></b>  ***Potential weakening of the positive relation between labour quality and labour productivity*** due to the ***prevalence of informal job contracts***
- India's structural transformation has been characterized by the **absorption of workers** in to the **construction sector**, along with **slow job creation** in the **service and manufacturing sectors**
- **Limited potential of productivity** in the construction and the services sector
- **Manufacturing** production offers **less scope of absorption of lower-skilled workers**
- Core problem of **formalisation and quality of employment** - still **over 85% of our workforce** is engaged in **unorganised labour** 

<b><u>FORMAL STAFFING INDUSTRY:</u></b> *is the segment of the staffing sector that provides organized, contractual, or temporary employment opportunities with benefits and social security contributions*.
1. **Staffing firms** can help **transition workers** from the informal to the forma sector by providing them **access to social security**.
2. Contribute to the **growth of MSMEs** by providing **flexible** and **skilled** workforce conforming to the changing nature of the manufacturing production.
3. Drive the shift towards **higher-productivity service sub-sectors**, by providing **access to skilled and qualified** workforce.
4. ***Every yearm 12Mn people join workforce, but capacity to train stands at 3.4Mn***. The Formal Staffing Industry could help, by providing **training, upskilling, and placement services** to jobseekers ensuring **better match between skilld of workforce and demands of employers**.
5. Boost the **IR4.0** as the **IT/ITeS sector** ***(contributing 7.8% to GDP)*** are in urgent need of skilled manpower which the staffing industry is well positioned to address

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***"By bridging the skill gap, the formal staffing industry ca play a vital role in India's journey towards more formalised and productive employment, contributing to the country's overall economic development".***

### **FOOD ADULTERATION**
#GS3 #Economy #FoodProcessing

<b><u>NEWS/DEFINITION/DATA:</u></b>
- Menace of **analogue/synthetic paneer** brought into news by **FSSAI's** testing of various samples in Noida
- <b><u>Definition:</u></b> ***Food adulteration*** is a process by which substances are either **intentionally added** to food items or food gets **contaminated** due to negligence or poor handling practices. ***Adulterants*** could be **harmful chemicals** or **harmless fillers**, and can be added at any stage of the production process.
	- #Eg *Dilution of milk*, *Edible oil mixed with mineral oil*
- <b><u>DATA:</u></b>
	- Survey by **UMoH&FW** tested food samples in various states and fount out up to **22% adulteration** if food items across various south Indian states
	- ***1/7 samples fail the test*** and are found to be adulterated
	- **Indian Express** suggests that **57% individuals** have had **health issues** as a result of **consuming adulterated food**.

<b><u>ISSUES WITH FOOD ADULTERATION:</u></b>
1. Food adulteration is present in both **organised** and **unorganised** sector
	- #Eg *Small sweets shops sell sweets with adulterated Khoya*
	- #Eg *Even big corporates sell adulterated foods - "EthyleneDioxide" found in Spices and "Sugar" content in Bournvita*
2. **Health issues** among **575 individuals** due to adulterated food items:
	- *Digestive disorders, Allergic reactions, Nutritional deficiencies, Weakened immune system, chronic diseases like Cancer and Liver damage*
3. Poor **nutritional content** due to adulteration - this coupled with already existing **underweight (32.1%), stunted (35.5%) and wasted(19.3%)** children exacerbate the issue.
	- It becomes difficult to **overcome nutritional deficiency** even through consumption of **milk** etc., as they are adulterated.
4. Threat of **obesity and diabetes:** for instance *mixing sugar syrup with Honey* 
	- #Data **Lancet data** suggests that **India** has the highest number of people with **diabetes** at ***212 Million***

<b><u>ROLE OF FSSAI AND INITIATIVES:</u></b>
1. **Ensuring compliance with various self-declaration and labeling mandates:**
	- **Mandate against GM ingredients:** any food item containing **5% of GM ingredients** should be **labelled**
		- GM cotton seed is often adulterated with other edible oils
		- Further, the mandate is based on **self-declaration** making **role of FSSAI** in **ensuring compliance** critical
	- **Mandate for organic food:** certified organic food must be free from any residues of insecticides and should be labelled accordingly.
2. **Identification of sellers**,**incentivization, education and raising awareness** among the **unorganized sellers**
	- <b><u>REASONS FOR UNORGANIZED SELLERS SELLING ADULTERATED FOOD ITEMS:</u></b>
		1. **Profit maximization**
		2. **Low conviction rate** is a reason behind the persistence of malpractices
		3. **Lack of food analysts** and **testing laboratories**

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b> *Generate points from above issues*
- **Stringent laws** with **differentiated approach** for **organised and unorganised** sectors
- **Food safety** must be ***seen as a matter of both Health & awareness****
- **Food hygiene** are also linked with **caste & class**, addressing the issue in s **differentiated approach** is again required

### **POVERTY ESTIMATES**
#GS1 #GS2 #GS3 #SocialIssues #Governance #Economy #Poverty

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- Government of India used **World Bank's "Poverty and Equity Brief"** of 2025 to state that ***"<b><u><i>171 million (~17 crore) lifted from extreme poverty in 10 years</i></u></b>"***, with current **poverty rate of** ***<b><u>5.75%</u></b>*** down from **27% in 2011-12** 

<b><u>WORLD BANK DATA ON POVERTY IN INDIA:</u></b>
1. **Historic conservative estimate:** according to new estimates, *India's poverty in the past were actually lower than previously estimated.*

2. **New poverty line:** 
	- At ***USD 3/day (at PPP)*** for **abject/extreme poverty**
		- #Data As per this, Indian **abject/extreme poverty** declined from *27%(34 crore) (2011-12)* to just **6%(7.5 crore) (2022-23)**
			- This is equivalent to ***INR 62/day*** (**NOTE:*** *PPP exchange rate of INR-USD is 20.6 INR = 1 USD* (2025))

	- As per some economists, ***"Poverty in India could be as low as 2% or as high as 82% depending on the choice of poverty line and methodology"***
  <p align="center"><img src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/T2.jpg" alt="Povert Line" width="450"/></p>

5. ***Women empowerment and mainstreaming:***
	- **Huge economic opportunity gap**: currently on 22% MSMEs are led by women when they are half of population. This points towards **potential of women led MSMEs** to achieve **Viksit Bharat**
	- *Without women participation*, India's **Demographic dividend** can't be reaped

<b><u>INITIATIVES/CASE-STUDIES:</u></b>
1. <b><u>Nari Adhikari Kendra (NAK)</u></b> initiative by **MP State Rural Livelihood Mission and Transform Rural India (TRI)** - it offers women a support ecosystem that includes mentorship, enterprise incubation, skilling, and market linkages
2. **Digitial innovation** like **ONDC** are allowing women led MSMEs to reach customers without traditional retail constraints
	- <b><u>Mann Deshi</u></b> and <b><u>Rang De</u></b> have pioneered ***women-friendly banking model***
3. **Women led MSMEs** offer a **high social and economic returns** and thus, are attractive destination of **CSR funds**

### **SDG LOCALISATION**
#GS3 #Economy #SustainableDevelopment #Report 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **NITI Aayog**  released the **District SDG Index 2023-24 for the North East Region (NER)** and ranked ***Hnahthial (Mizoram)*** as the **best performing district** in NER.
- India entered **top 100** for the **first time** and ranked **99** in **UNSDN's** ***Sustainable Development Report 2025***

<b><u>SIGNIFICANCE OF LOCALISING SDG GOALS</u></b>
1. **Local spaces as key site of delivery:** State-level **Vision and Agenda** documents sets targets for implementation and monitors it through **Village Level Monitoring Committee**, like in **Mizoram.**
2. **Bottom-up approach:** subnational government acts as a **bridge** between the National government and the communities fostering civil society, academia and private sector participation.
3. **Mobilizing local resources:** by adopting measures to **align state budgets** with SDGs
4. **Address disparities:** local achievements would overcome **intra-regional** and **inter-district disparities** and align it with **national average**
5. **Ensures saturation approach:** where every individual contributes to wards SDG achievement. #Eg **UP's Fatehpur village with no bridge - locals tried building a bridge themselves, but that was stopped by the authorities**. Localisation of SDGs is necessary to address such cases.

<b><u>CHALLENGES IN SDG LOCALISATION:</u></b>
1. **Financial constraints:** *competing priorities* in municipal budgets, where essential services like healthcare and education may take *precedence over sustainability projects.*
2. **Intersectionality of Goals:** local governments may struggle to *balance economic growth* with *environmental sustainability*.
3. **Data quality and availability:** lack of *up-to date socio-economic data* hampers evidence based decision-making.
4. **Challenges of unaddressed issues** as per **SDG-NIF Report by MosPI 2025**
	1. Rising **adolescent birth rates** in girls
	2. Rise in **road accident fatalities**
	3. Decline in **issuance of soil health cards**
	4. Reduction in **primary government expenditure** as a proportion of original approved budget

<b><u>INDIA AND SDG LOCALISATION:</u></b>
- **NITI Aayog:**
	- *Competitive and Cooperative federalism*
	- **SDG India Index**
	- **Agenda 2030**, etc.
- **Schemes/Initiatives:**
	- **Panchayat Advancement Index (PAI)**
	- **Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA)**
	- **PMAY**
	- State schemes like CM's **Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana** of Assam

### **CIRCULAR ECONOMY**
#GS3 #Economy #SustainableDevelopment 

<b><u>CIRCULAR ECONOMY:</u></b>
> #Quote ***"In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste – the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place."***

> #Definition ***The circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature is regenerated. In a circular economy, products and materials are kept in circulation through processes like maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacture, recycling, and composting.

<b><u>NEWS/DATA:</u></b>
- India to host **World Circular Economy Forum 2026**
- India's circular economy could generate a **market value of over USD 2 Trillion and create close to 10 Million jobs by 2050**
- **EAC-PM circular economy could lower India's GHG emissions by 23% in 2030 and 44% in 2050, at current rate of development**
- **Circularity Gap Report 2024** says tahat the use of **secondary materials** in the **global economy** has **declined** from *9% in 2018* to **7.2% in 2023**

<b><u>FRAMEWORK FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY:</u></b>
<p align="center"><img src="CircularEconomy.jpg" alt="Circular Economy" width="700"/><br><i>Allen McArthur Circular Economy Framework</i></p>

<b><u>THREE PRINCIPLES OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY ARE:</u></b>
1. Eliminate waste and pollution
2. Circulate products and materials at their highest value
3. Regenerate nature

<b><u>BENEFITS</u></b>
1. **Resource self-sufficiency** - mobile phones and cellular technologies become quickly obsolete and consumers buy new devices, fueling India's rising electronics imports.
2. **Slowdown of climate change** - As per **EAC-PM circular economy could lower India's GHG emissions by 23% in 2030 and 44% in 2050, at current rate of development**
3. **New jobs and a strengthened economy:** As per **ILO**, circular economy can generate **6 million jobs globally by 2030** and **FICCI** estimates around **USD 500 Billion** in **investments** in circular economy.
	- #Eg ***Infinity Box*** - offers food packaging as a service with renewable boxes.

<b><u>INDIAN INITATIVES:</u></b>
- Launch of **SBM Waste to Wealth PMS (Panchayat Managment System) portal**
- Release of ***"India's Circular Sutra"*** - a compendium of best practices in **3R & Circular Economy**
	- **3R:*** ***Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle***
- **Extended producer responsibility (EPR)** rules applying to: plastice packaging, e-waste, battery waste, tyre waste, waste oil, and scrap of non-ferrous metals
- **Right to repair** portal by **Ministry of Consumer Affairs** covering *farming equipment, mobiles/electronic display and data storage components, consumer durable, and automobiles equipment*
