### GDP BASE YEAR REVISION
#GS3 #Economy #GDP 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- The current **GDP base year** is planned to be revised to **2022-2023** and the revised series of data will be released from February, 2026. The same will be accompanied with revision of base year for **IIP** to **2022-23** and **CPI** also to **2022-2023**.
- **First set of GDP estimates:** compiled by **National Income Committee** under **PC Mahalanobis** in 1949. Since, then **CSO** undertook GDP calculation and till present, **7 base year revisions** have been carried out, most recent being in 2015.

<b><u>RATIONALE BEHIND GDP BASE YEAR REVISION:</u></b>
1. To **accurately understand and report the state of the real economy**. Most recent price-levels offer better insight into relative GDP growth. 
2. To **capture the fundamental changes in the economy** - the era of quick-commerce, ed. tech. needs to be considered as a part of the base to accurately judge the future growth of GDP.
3. **New data sources and workforce estimates** for the unorganized/informal sector need to be accounted by revising the base year, as economy formalizes.
	- CSO was using NSSO survey, which was carried out every 5 years. Thus, revision must ideally be every 5 years.
	- Now, with **HCES** and proposed **updates to the PLFS**, right time to update the GDP base year.
4. India is on **cusp** of becoming the **3rd largest economy** and there are **concerns** about **India's GDP calculation method** - many experts have expressed that India's GDP measurements are overstated along with various data quality issues.
5. Revision can be coupled with other **data reforms** like **PPI instead of WPI** while trying to improve the estimate accuracies.

<b><u>WHY BASE YEAR NOT CHANGED IN 2017-18?:</u></b> ***"Missed cycle in 2017-18"***
1. The **HCES** and **PLFS**, on which the revision was based, ran into trouble with **government itself raising data quality issues**.
2. As per the government, **2017-18** were **"abnormal"** years due to the earlier **demonetization (2016)** and **GST (2017)**.
3. Further, **COVID-19** pandemic plagued the later years.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> A concern however, is that the year of 2022-23 witnessed **pentup-demand** post the **COIVD-19** pandemic. This could lead to the new estimates being lower than expected. Though, update is required in conformity with the **UN-SMA** accounting methods.

### INFLATION RATE
#GS3 #Economy #Data #Inflation

<b><u>Recent MOSPI Data on Inflation for May 2025</u></b>:
- India's Headline retail inflation - **CPI - 2.82%** compared to **4.8%** in May 2024, to a **75 month low**.

### FORMAL STAFFING INDUSTRY
#GS3 #Economy #Employment 

<b><u>BACKGROUND:</u></b>  ***Potential weakening of the positive relation between labour quality and labour productivity*** due to the ***prevalence of informal job contracts***
- India's structural transformation has been characterized by the **absorption of workers** in to the **construction sector**, along with **slow job creation** in the **service and manufacturing sectors**
- **Limited potential of productivity** in the construction and the services sector
- **Manufacturing** production offers **less scope of absorption of lower-skilled workers**
- Core problem of **formalisation and quality of employment** - still **over 85% of our workforce** is engaged in **unorganised labour** 

<b><u>FORMAL STAFFING INDUSTRY:</u></b> *is the segment of the staffing sector that provides organized, contractual, or temporary employment opportunities with benefits and social security contributions*.
1. **Staffing firms** can help **transition workers** from the informal to the forma sector by providing them **access to social security**.
2. Contribute to the **growth of MSMEs** by providing **flexible** and **skilled** workforce conforming to the changing nature of the manufacturing production.
3. Drive the shift towards **higher-productivity service sub-sectors**, by providing **access to skilled and qualified** workforce.
4. ***Every yearm 12Mn people join workforce, but capacity to train stands at 3.4Mn***. The Formal Staffing Industry could help, by providing **training, upskilling, and placement services** to jobseekers ensuring **better match between skilld of workforce and demands of employers**.
5. Boost the **IR4.0** as the **IT/ITeS sector** ***(contributing 7.8% to GDP)*** are in urgent need of skilled manpower which the staffing industry is well positioned to address

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***"By bridging the skill gap, the formal staffing industry ca play a vital role in India's journey towards more formalised and productive employment, contributing to the country's overall economic development".***

### FOOD ADULTERATION
#GS3 #Economy #FoodProcessing

<b><u>NEWS/DEFINITION/DATA:</u></b>
- Menace of **analogue/synthetic paneer** brought into news by **FSSAI's** testing of various samples in Noida
- <b><u>Definition:</u></b> ***Food adulteration*** is a process by which substances are either **intentionally added** to food items or food gets **contaminated** due to negligence or poor handling practices. ***Adulterants*** could be **harmful chemicals** or **harmless fillers**, and can be added at any stage of the production process.
	- #Eg *Dilution of milk*, *Edible oil mixed with mineral oil*
- <b><u>DATA:</u></b>
	- Survey by **UMoH&FW** tested food samples in various states and fount out up to **22% adulteration** if food items across various south Indian states
	- ***1/7 samples fail the test*** and are found to be adulterated
	- **Indian Express** suggests that **57% individuals** have had **health issues** as a result of **consuming adulterated food**.

<b><u>ISSUES WITH FOOD ADULTERATION:</u></b>
1. Food adulteration is present in both **organised** and **unorganised** sector
	- #Eg *Small sweets shops sell sweets with adulterated Khoya*
	- #Eg *Even big corporates sell adulterated foods - "EthyleneDioxide" found in Spices and "Sugar" content in Bournvita*
2. **Health issues** among **575 individuals** due to adulterated food items:
	- *Digestive disorders, Allergic reactions, Nutritional deficiencies, Weakened immune system, chronic diseases like Cancer and Liver damage*
3. Poor **nutritional content** due to adulteration - this coupled with already existing **underweight (32.1%), stunted (35.5%) and wasted(19.3%)** children exacerbate the issue.
	- It becomes difficult to **overcome nutritional deficiency** even through consumption of **milk** etc., as they are adulterated.
4. Threat of **obesity and diabetes:** for instance *mixing sugar syrup with Honey* 
	- #Data **Lancet data** suggests that **India** has the highest number of people with **diabetes** at ***212 Million***

<b><u>ROLE OF FSSAI AND INITIATIVES:</u></b>
1. **Ensuring compliance with various self-declaration and labeling mandates:**
	- **Mandate against GM ingredients:** any food item containing **5% of GM ingredients** should be **labelled**
		- GM cotton seed is often adulterated with other edible oils
		- Further, the mandate is based on **self-declaration** making **role of FSSAI** in **ensuring compliance** critical
	- **Mandate for organic food:** certified organic food must be free from any residues of insecticides and should be labelled accordingly.
2. **Identification of sellers**,**incentivization, education and raising awareness** among the **unorganized sellers**
	- <b><u>REASONS FOR UNORGANIZED SELLERS SELLING ADULTERATED FOOD ITEMS:</u></b>
		1. **Profit maximization**
		2. **Low conviction rate** is a reason behind the persistence of malpractices
		3. **Lack of food analysts** and **testing laboratories**

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b> *Generate points from above issues*
- **Stringent laws** with **differentiated approach** for **organised and unorganised** sectors
- **Food safety** must be ***seen as a matter of both Health & awareness****
- **Food hygiene** are also linked with **caste & class**, addressing the issue in s **differentiated approach** is again required
