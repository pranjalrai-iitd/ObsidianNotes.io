<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **Global Drought Outlook** report released by **OECD** (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)

<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- **Findings of Global Drought Outlook:**
	- **Increase in severity:** ***40%*** of the **world's land area** faces increasingly frequent and severe droughts
	- **Economic impact:** ***3%-7.5%*** **annual increase** in the **economic cost** of an average drought episode
		- **Inland waterways** are adversely affected
		- **Crop yields** can decline by **22%**
	- **Ecological impact:**
		- **Reduction in soil moisture:** since 1980, **37%** of global land has experienced significant moisture decline
		- **Ground-water decline:** falling globally, with **62%** monitored aquifers in decline
- **WMO, 2021:** Droughts are responsible for **34% of disaster-related deaths** and exacerbate **poverty, inequality and displacement**

<b><u>Types of droughts:</u></b>
1.  **Meteorological droughts:** is defined on the basis of **degree of dryness** and the **duration** of the dry period. Definitions can be **region-specific** and may relate **actual precipitation departures** to average amounts.
2. **Agricultural drought:** links various characteristics of drought to **agricultural impacts**, focusing on **precipitation shortages**, difference between actual and potential **evapotranspiration**, **soil water defects**, reduced **groundwater** or reservoir levels.
3. **Hydrological droughts:** is associated with the effects of **period of precipitation(including snowfall) shortfalls** on **surface or subsurface water supply**. The frequency and severity of hydrological drought is often defined on a watershed or river basin scale.
4. **Socioeconomic droughts:** is associated with the supply and demand of socioeconomic goods with elements of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought. Its occurrence may not be concurrent with other forms of drought. 
5. **Ecological droughts:** a prolonged and widespread deficit in naturally available water supplies - including climate changes in natural and managed hydrology - that creates multiple stresses across ecosystems.

<b><u>Initiatives for prevention of droughts</u></b>
- **Global:**
	- **UNCCD** convention to combat desertification - to achieve **Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN)** by **2030**
	- **International Drought Management Program**, jointly led by the World Meteorological Organization **(WMO)** and the **Global Water Partnership**
- **India:**
	- National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System **(NADAMS)**
	- **Watershed Development**, a component of **WDC-PMKSY**
	- **Atal Bhujal Yojana**

### **HEAT WAVES**
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #Report

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- New study by **CEEW** (Council on Energy, Environment and Water) on ***District-level heat Risk*** developed a ***Heat Risk Index (HRI)***
	- It suggests, ***57% of districts are at high hear risk*** in India
- **Heat Risk Index (HRI)** is based on **35 indicators**. Some indicators are:
	- Increase in frequency of very hot days
	- Population density
	- % persons with disability
	- Change in land use and land cover

<b><u>Heat wave:</u></b> As per **IMD**, heatwave is considered if **maximum temperature** of a **station** reaches **at least 40 degree C** for **plains** and **at least 30 degree C** for **Hilly** regions. The two criteria are as follows, and they have to be **met for at least 2 stations** in a Meteorological sub-division:
- **Based on departure from normal:**
	- **Heat Wave:** Departure from the normal is **4.5 - 6.4 degree C**
	- **Severe Heat Wave:** Departure from the normal is **>6.4 degree C**
- **Based on actual maximum temperature:**
	- **Heat Wave:** When actual temperature **>=45 degree C**
	- **Severe Heat Wave:** When actual temperature **>=47 degree C**

<b><u>Heat  risk:</u></b> is ***probability* of experiencing heat-related illness or death due to exposure to extreme temperatures**. As per **CEEW**, it depends on 3 crucial factors:
1. **Intensity of heat:** and its compounding effects like *humidity*
2. **Degree of exposure**
3. **Underlying vulnerabilities of affected communities**

### **CHANGING FLOOD PATTERN**
#GS3 #DisasterManagement #Floods #Report 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **IIT Delhi** and **IIT Roorkee** have found that **riverine floods in India** are **changing** in terms of ***magnitude, size and intensity***, over the **past 40 years**.

<b><u>CHANGES AS PER THE REPORT:</u></b>
1. **Decline in flood magnitude:** Around 74% stations showed decreasing flood magnitude trends whereas 26% showed increasing trends.
	- ***Larger catchments experienced reduced flood magnitudes***
	- **Region specific variation:**
		- **West and Central Ganga basin:** saw **17% decline** per decade in *monsoon floods* due to *declining precipitation* and *soil moisture*
		- **Narmada basin:** consistent *decrease* in the magnitudes of floods mainly on the account of *dam construction*
		- **Marathwada region:** river flows are **decreasing at 8%** during Monsoon and **31%** in pre-Monsoon season
2. **Rise in pre-Monsoon Flood intensity:** increase of **8%** per decade in *pre-monsoon flood intensity* particularly on the **Malabar coast** due to ***rising pre-Monsoon rainfall**
3. **Shift in flood timing:** 
	- **Upper Ganga** - ***delayed floods***
	- **Central India** - ***earlier floods***
	- **Southern India** - generally sees ***later floods***

<b><u>IMPLICATION OF CHANGING FLOOD PATTERNS:</u></b>
1. **Reservoir operations and water security:** declining floods may mean **lower reservoir levels** affecting water supply, irrigation and hydropwer.
2. **Overhauling of flood management system:** increased focus on **early warning systems**, ***green buffers***, **smart planning** and **resilient infrastructure**.
