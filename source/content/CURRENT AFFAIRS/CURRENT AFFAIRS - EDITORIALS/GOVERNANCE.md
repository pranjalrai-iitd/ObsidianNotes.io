### **MGNREGS SPENDING CAP**
#GS2 #GS3 #Scheme #Employment #SocialSecurity

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> Union Finance Ministry has **capped spending** under the **MGNREGS** at **60%** of its **annual allocation** for the **first half of FY26**

<b><u>FEATURES OF MGNREGS:</u></b>
- Largest **social security** programme offering ** demand based employment as a statutory right**
- **Section 3(1) of MGNREGA Act 2005:** ***guarantees 100 days of employment*** in a year to **ruaral HH** whose adult members volunteer to do **unskilled manual labor**
	- **Legally back guarantee** for any rural adult to **get work within 15 days** of demanding it
- **1/3 of MGNREGA beneficiaries** are **women**
- 100 days have not became **de facto upper limit** as the **NREGA software** does not allow data entries for employment above 100 days to a household in a financial year **unless specifically requested by state/UT**
	- In some cases, **government** allows **additional 50 days of wage** employment like, **ST HHs in forest areas** are entitled to get **150 days** provided that such families have no other private property expect for land rights under the FRA, 2006
	- Under the **Section3(4)**, the government can also provide an **additional 50 days** of unskilled work in **rural areas** where a **drought** or any **natural calamity** is notified by **MHA**.

<b><u>NEED FOR THE CAP:</u></b>
1. Financial troubles with MGNREGA - thus, brought under the MEP/QEP
2. High pending dues - 70% funds are exhausted by September and 100% exhausted by January

<b><u>ISSUES WITH MGNREGS EXPENDITURE CAP</u></b>
1. MGNREGS has been brought under the **Monthly Expenditure Plan/Quarterly Expenditure Plan (MEP/QEP)**, a **spending control mechanism** introduced by Finance Ministry in 2017. Earlier, it was exempt on account of being demand driven.
2. **Issue of fluctuating demand:** work demand fluctuates throughout the year linked with agricultural activities and weather patterns. **Expenditure cap does not take into account these contingencies**.
	- In **2023**, low rainfall led to 20% higher work demand than usual in July and August, with **Karnataka in particular spending more than 70% of the annual MGNREGS budget within 6 months due to extreme drought**.
	3.**Legality issues:** for social security schemes which are based on specific legislations, the **government has limited power to determine the implementation modalities**
	- #Judgement <b><u>Swaraj Abhiyan Vs Union of India (2016):</u></b> SC has held that **financial inability cannot** be a reason to **disregard statutory or constitutional duties**.

### **DATA GOVERNANCE**
#GS2 #GS3 #Governance #SciTech #DataGovernance #Report 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **NITI Aayog** released the report titled, **"India's Data Imperative: The Pivot Towards Quality"*** highlighting that over past decade, India has emerged as a ***global leader in digital public infrastructure***.
- India now enters the **next phase of its digital journey** where the focus must shift from ***merely scaling*** to ***prioritizing quality data***

<b><u>DATA QUALITY:</u></b>
- **Quality data** consists of **6 core attributes:**
	- ***Accuracy***, 
	- ***Completeness***, 
	- ***Timeliness***, 
	- ***Consistency***,
	- ***Validity***, and 
	- ***Uniqueness***
- The report introduces a ***Data-Quality Scorecard*** to monitor and improve datasets, as well as a ***Data-Quality Maturity Framework*** having **7 dimensions** and **5 levels of maturities:**
	1. *Data Governance & Ownership*
	2. *Standards & Metadata*
	3. *Data Capture & Validation Controls*
	4. *Quality Monitoring & Reporting*
	5. *Standards & Metadata*
	6. *Data Capture & Validation Controls*
	7. *Quality Monitoring & Reporting*

<b><u>NEED OF QUALITY DATA FOR GOVERNANCE:</u></b>
1. **Fortifies digital governance:** powering efficient digital platforms, such as UPI and Aadhar, and ensures the smoother delivery of government services
2. **Prevents wastage:** ***errors or duplicate entries can inflate welfare budgets by 4-7% annually***
3. **Cultivate public trust:** poor data leads to incorrect targeting, delays, and citizen frustration. Quality data avoids such mismatches, and rejected claims

<b><u>CHALLENGES IN LEVERAGING QUALITY DATA FOR GOOF GOVERNANCE:</u></b>
1. **Faulty data capture:** field programs prioritize **speed over correctness**, resulting in a culture where, *80% accuracy is considered "good enough*
2. **Fragmented Data storage:** some systems utilize *modern cloud tools*, but any rely on *outdated databases* that lack audit trails and a standardized structure
3. **Inconsistent Data sharing:** different departments employ varying formats and update schedules, resulting in *slow and expensive data integration.*
4. **Poor archival practices:** old, outdated records are rarely removes, cluttering systems and slowing performance 

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. ***Three fast fixes:***
	1. **Fix at the source** - build validation, de-duplication, and metadata standards into data capture stages
	2. **Maintain cleanliness** - monthly audits, designate data stewards and connect public grievances to correction processes
	3. **Embed accountability** - deploy dashboards tracking key data quality KPIs
2. **For structural transformation:**
	1. Appoint dedicated **data stewards** at national, state and district levels
	2. **Linking budget allocations and departmental performance to data quality**
	3. **Driving interoperability** with **standardized schemas** and APIs
	4. Embedding **data ownership** within departmental roles, backed by incentives

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***"Trust, not volume, defines the future of digital India"***
