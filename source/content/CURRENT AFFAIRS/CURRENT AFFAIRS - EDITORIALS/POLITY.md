### **DELIMITATION**
#GS2 #GS1 #SocialIssues #Delimitation #Census #Demography

<b><u>NEWS/INTRO:</u></b> 
- The current freeze on delimitation - which for the past 50 years has based the allocation of seats to states in the Lok Sabha on the census figures of 1971 - will expire in 2026.
- **Article 82:** mandates delimitation after each census to readjust the seats as per population changes

<b><u>WHY FREEZE?</u></b>
- Concern of the **southern states** that because their population had stabilized while population of some northern states had begun to grow at a brisk pace, their relative representation in the Lok Sabha would go down.
- The freeze was put in place first in **1976** for **25 years** through a **constitutional amendment**, which was later extended for another 25 years in **2002** though another amendment.

<b><u>FUTURE OF FREEZE ON DELIMITATION:</u></b>
- GoI's plan is to have a **delimitation and implement women's reservation** in the **2029 LS elections**, before which Census must conclude.
- Freeze would require **amendment to Article 81**:
	- 81 limits the strength of Lok Sabha to 550 and it must be amended to revise the strength
	- **Article 81(2)(a)**, which provides the principle of **"one person, one vote, one value"** along with an exception of small states, needs to be amended if southern states are to be treated specially.
		- This might be challenged in Supreme Court as violative of **Article 14 and 15**.
		- Using **reasonable classification** i.e, "likes be treated alike" - better social and economic indicators require special protection for Southern states. However, this will be an **anti-affirmative action** and is exact opposite of the logic that permits reservation.

### **FREE SPEECH & CENSORSHIP**
#GS2 #FundamentalRights
>***"Censorship is like no-confidence in individual's autonomous agency"*** - PB Mehta
- Free speech is based on **various trust levels**:
	- **Trust in individuals** that they would not easily be incited, inflamed or manipulated.
	- **Trust in speakers ability** to able to make a distinction between the right to speech and the value of the speech.
- Rather than Hate speech in itself, the social **distrust** is what causes negative externalities.
- **Traditionally there was high bar on state intervention and censorship because of dialectical principles:**
	1. One is to rely on **social judgement rather than censorship** to hold speech accountable. Understanding the value of speech is much favorable than censorship: *"We can let a few weeds grow if we are confident that weeds shall not destroy the wheat"*.
	2. **Censorship** always **incites** a political **economy of mobilization, competitive victim-hood**, tested on the site of speech. This is because community identities are based on benchmarks and taboos. In multicultural societies, every community brings its taboo - so the occasional exception becomes the norms. For instance blasphemy laws protect one religion. They now have to protect every religion or nation.
- ***"Crisis of speech is crisis of mistrust and cannot be solved by legal censorship".***

> #Quote ***"Censorship reflects a society's lack of confidence in itself".***  - Porter Stewart

### **ACCOUNTABILITY IN HIGHER JUDICIARY**
#GS2 #Judiciary #MainsValueAddition 

<b><u>IN-HOUSE PROCEDURE:</u></b>
- #Judgement In the ***C.Ravichandran Iyer vs Justice AM Bhattacharjee (1995)***, the SC **validated peer-review model**.
- In 1997, SC adopted the ***Restatement of values of judicial life*** for internal inquiry, authorizing **CJI** to constitute an in-house committee to investigate allegations against judges.

<b><u>LEGAL PROVISIONS:</u></b> #Judgement ***Veeraswami Case, 1991***
- Judges can be **prosecuted** only with **CJI's consent**
- Ensure **balance** between **accountability** and **protection from harassment**
- **No bar on FIRs and seizure** of evidence **without naming judges**

<b><u>GLOBAL REFERENCES:</u></b> of Canada, USA and Australia wherein initial investigations are conducted by a judicial body, with legislative involvement occurring later.

<b><u>LAW COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS:</u></b> ***Judicial (Inquiry) Bill 2005:***
- Establishing the **National Judicial Council**, which was set to consist of 5 judges with CJI as a chairman.
- **Principles:**
	- ***Siracusa Principles*** (1981)
	- ***Latimer guidelines for the Commonwealth*** (1998)

<b><u>ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES:</u></b>
- ***"Justice must be done and seen to be done"*** - transparency but also accountability.
- **Harry T Edwards** from Columbia - peer review enhanced, not diminishes, judicial independence.

### **AI IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE**
#GS2 #GS3 #AI #SciTech #Judiciary 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> The recent initiatives like  **CCTNS** (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems), the **ICJS** (Inter-operable Criminal Justice System), and the **NAFRS** (National Automated Facial Recognition System), reflect the future inclination of **integrating AI in criminal justice system**

<b><u>ISSUES:</u></b>
1. AI reflects various **social biases** - caste, gender, religion, skin color, language and region. AI use can **reinforce these biases**
	- #Eg A **2018 MIT study** found **facial recognition** systems had a **0.8%** **error-rate** for **white men**, but **34.7%** for **dark-skinned women**
	- #Eg **UN-Women** warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare.
2. In India, there is **no specific legal framework** to **regulate the use of AI**. Yet, tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions.
3. **LLMs** are trained on existing datasets, but these datasets are shaped by **unequal access**. There is **no unified Indian dataset**, which is further complicated by the **digial inequality** within India.
	- #Eg As per **Oxfam India Inequaity Report 2022**, **women** use the Internet **33%** less than men. Only **31%** of rural Indians are online, compared to **67%** in urban areas. There is also **skew** against marginalized groups like **dalits**.
4. AI in criminal justice can be a **threat to the marginalized** as ***AI can replicate past injustices***
	- **NCRB data** shows that over **55% of undertrials** come from Dalit, Adiviasi, or Muslim backgrounds. AI can **re-inforce** these **skew** through **biased data discrimination**.
	- #Eg **USA**'s **COMPAS algorithm** used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk to Black defendants compared to White defendants.

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. Government must **enact regulations** to ensure AI remains **inclusive, transparent, and accountable**
2. There should be **Indian datasets** which **corrects** for the **data inequality** against the **marginalized sections**.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***"AI development should be centered around the needs of the marginalized communities to ensure equitable progress".***

### **DELAYS IN DISTRICT COURTS**
#GS2 #Judiciary 

<b><u>NEWS/DATA:</u></b> #MainsValueAddition 
- Around **75%** of **High Court** cases and **63%** of **lower courts** are **more than a year old** saturating the judicial fora.
- #Judgement ***K Vadivel Vs. K Shanthi and Other:*** Sc noted that ***"denial of speedy and timely justice can be disastrous to rule of law in the long term".***
<b><u>TRADITIONAL REASONS:</u></b> ***"Resource crunch"***
1. **Judicial vacancies:** Inadequate number of Judges
	- **5,000 - 70,000** vacancies at the level of district courts with **sanctioned strength** at **25,771**
2. Insufficient **funding**

<b><u>TRADITIONAL VIEW IS FLAWED:</u></b>
1. Calculation of vacancies is based on a method which takes into account the required number of judges per the population of the country. This gives 70K vacancies. However, expert committees have discredited this method.
2. **Parliament's data** provides that there are **5,292 vacancies**. However, these vacancies must be viewed in the context of **tripling of sanctioned vacancies** from 7.5K (1980) to **26K**.
3. Judicial system has been **simplified** with tribunals like **DRT**, **NCLT** etc.
4. In the last 2 decades, government has allocated **Rs.12,000 Cr** to improve **physical & digital infrastructure** of district courts.
5. **13th FC** recommended **Rs.5000 Cr** for judiciary, most of which remains **unspent**

<b><u>FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR JUDICIAL DELAYS:</u></b>
1. **Issues with judicial inquiries:**
	- **Arbitrariness in disciplining the district judges:**
		- Unlike SC, HC where Parliamentary impeachment is possible. District judges are subject to **same disciplinary rules** like civil servants. However, these rules are applied by HC instead of the state government.
		- **Arbitrary dismissal** of **judges with integrity**, citing **too generous in granting compensation in land acquisition cases** or for **granting bail too frequently**
		- ***Judges are being disciplined for legal errors and not misconduct***, despite existence of appellate authorities - this is unprecedented in any country. 
	- **Ineffective inquiries:** even when there are allegations of misconduct, such as corruption and bribery, inquires are **heavily influenced** by **rumors and hearsay**. 
	- **Closed door nature of inquiries**
2. **Issues with the** ***"Unit method"*** **of assessing judicial performance:**
	- **Unit system** is based on **disposal targets** where judges are expected to complete some predetermined *units* of judicial tasks.
	- The *unit system* does **not** factors in the **time or complexity** of the judicial tasks.
	- This results in **skewed assessment of judicial performance**
3. ***"Revolving Dockets"***
	- In most countries, a case remains on a **single docket** with a single judge. However, in India **cases revolve between dockets of different judges** since, the cases in the court remains but, judges get transferred.
	- It becomes difficult to **enforce accountability** on a single judge.

### **POLITICAL FUNDING IN INDIA**
#GS2 #Polity #Elections #ElectoralReforms #Report #Data

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) Report*** highlighted that ***many parties delayed submitting expenditure statements (by 1 to 232 days), and some failed to report altogether after the 2024 general elections***

<b><u>ECI's mandate:</u></b>
		- **Expenditure limits:**
			- **INR 95 lakh** for **Lok Sabha**
			- **INR 40 Lakh** for **Assembly**
		- Political parties are required to submit election expenditure statements to ECI within,
			- **90 days** for **general elections**
			- **75 days** for **assembly elections**

<b><u>Issues in political financing in India:</u></b> #Data 
1. **Expensive elections:** the **2024 Lok Sabha Elections** became the ****most expensive electoral event in the world***, with expenditure reaching ***INR 1.35 Lakh Cr***
2. **Lack of transparency:** approximately **60% contributions** to the **6 major political parties** from 2005-2023 **came from undisclosed sources**
3. **Disparity in political funding** in **2024 elections**: **National parties** collected **93% of total funds**
4. **Electoral overspending:** despite ECI's expenditure limits, actual spending **exceed these caps**, often with the help of **third-party campaigners** and loopholes in **MCC**
5. **Wealth emerging as a key factor in electoral success:** limiting opportunities for affluent contenders
	- In **Madhya Pradesh**, **44%** of winning candidates declared assets over **INR 5 Cr**

<b><u>Recommendations:</u></b> #MainsValueAddition 
1. ***Law Commission*** recommends **cap on the expenditure** to be incurred for an election by the **political party**
2. ***Indrajit Gupta committee:*** #committee recommended **state funding of elections** to **reduce disparities** among political parties
3. **ADR** recommends expenditure must be limited to **transactions via cheque/DD/RTGS** so as to reduce the use of black money
4. ***European model:*** state **electoral funds** where all money is collected and then distributed among the parties based on their vote share of other parameters.
5. **No private funding** and a **small cess(INR 1) on fuel** for **public funding of elections**

### **KERALA CONTROVERSY ON BHARAT MATA PORTRAIT AT RAJ BHAVAN**
#GS2 #Polity #Governor #MainsValueAddition #Quote 
- **The national movement never adopted any picture of the Bharat Mata**. 
- Neither the **constitution or any law** unlike the **national anthem or national flag or national symbols.***
- **Meaning of Bharat Mata as per Jawahar Lal Nehru** in ***Discovery of India:***
	>*"... sometimes as I reached a gathering a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki Jai - Victory to Mother India. I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Bharat Mata, whose victory they wanted... The mountains and the rivers of India and the forest and the broad fields which gave us food were all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of India, people like them and me who were spread out all over this vast land. ***Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these millions of people and victory to her meant victory to those people***."

### **FILMS & FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION**
#GS2 #Polity #FundamentalRights #Films

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- The Supreme Court has characterized a "ban" on the **CBFC certified** Tamil film **"Thug Life"** in Karnataka as an infringement on the filmmaker's constitutionally guaranteed **right to freedom of speech and expression**. The court also directed the state to uphold the **"rule of law"**.
> #Quote ***"Upholding freedom of speech means protecting and extending the space for a diversity of views. It is not just screening of a film, it's much bigger than this."***

<b><u>CBFC certification:</u></b>
- **CBFC** is a **statutory body** formed by the **Cinematograph Act, 1952** under the **MoI&B**
- In India, all films must have a CBFC certificate if they are to be release theatrically, telecast on television, or displayed publicly in any way.
	- **NOTE:** #Prelims There is **no CBCF certification for TV programs and serials**. However, under **Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995** the **Content Code/ Advertisement Code** applied.
- The **4 categories are:**
	- **U:** Unrestricted public exhibition (suitable for all age groups)
	- **U/A (UA7+, UA13+, and UA16+):** Parental guidance for children
	- **A:** Restricted to adults (>=18)
	- **S:** Restricted to a specialized group of people, such as engineers, doctors or scientists
- **Need of film certification:** As per **Supreme court** in a ***K.A. Abbas vs UoI, 1978*** #Judgement: ***"Certification by prior restraint is not only desirable but also necessary"***
	1. Film **motivates thought** and **action**
	2. Film assures a **high degree of attention and retention** as compared to printed works
	3. The combination of act and speech, sight and sound in semi-darkness of the theatre with elimination of all distracting ideas will have a strong impact on the minds of the viewers and can **effect emotions**
	4. Films have much **potential for evil as they have for good** and have an **equal potential to instill or cultivate violent or good behavior.**

<b><u>LEGAL TESTS REGARDING FILMS AND FoSE:</u></b>
- **Hecklin Test:** narrow interpretation on restricting films for display of explicit content in movies
- **Roth Test:** liberal interpretation where the focus is on message being sent by the film. #Eg Breast Feeding shown to promote child health should not be restricited
- **Brandenburg Test:** Speech must be restricted only if it incites violence

<b><u>HORIZONTAL APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 19</u></b> was recognized by the Supreme court in #Judgement ***Kaushal Kishore Case (2023)***
- **Vertical application:** protected against the **state**
- **Horizontal application:** protected against **another citizens**

### **PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES**
#GS2 #Polity #Parliament 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
> #Quote ***"Parliamentary committees act as supportive and corrective instruments, offering constructive guidance"***  - Lok Sabha Speaker

<b><u>Parliamentary Committees:</u></b> are panels on Members of Parliament formed to scrutinise the functioning of the government and to uphold executive accountability
- Two types of Parliamentary committees:
	- **Standing committees:** 
		- **3 Financial Committees** - Estimates Committee, Public Accounts Committee, and Committee on Public Undertaking
		- **24 DRSC**s
	- **Ad hoc Committees** - constituted for specified purpose and cease to exist on finishing their tasks - includes **Select and Joint Committees on Bills**

<b><u>SIGNIFICANCE OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES:</u></b>
1. **Ensure accountability and oversight on executive:** Need for vigilance on the part of the Legislature over the Executive actions
	- #Eg examines the **government expenditure** through the **Public Accounts Committee**
2. **Legislative impact assessment:** suggests reforms in law such that highest positive impact possible
	- #Eg  *MVA 2016 Amendment* - limited insurance payout to INR 10 lakh, but standing committee recommended that awarded by court so no need of statutory cap
3. **Budgetary assessment by DRSCs:** through the 24 Department Related Standing Committees (DSRCs)
4. **Transparent and effective governance:** by offering well-researched recommendations and acting as a bridge between executive and the legislature
5. **Improves legislative efficiency:** as the size of the Parliament increases and work load increases - Parliamentary committee provides an avenue for in-depth legislative work, with specialized focus on particular bills
6. **Building consensus and ensures "cohabitation":** provides a forum for **cross party cooperation**

<b><u>ISSUES WITH PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES:</u></b>
1. **Short tenure and delays** in constituting committees and **closed-door meetings**
2. **Low attendance of MPs in committee meetings** - in 17th LS, **average attendance was:**
	- ***47%*** - subject committees
	- ***37%*** - financial committees
3. **Declining number of bills being referred** to the committees - only **16% in 17th LS** compared to **60% in 14th LS**
4. **Venkatachaliah Commission (2000):** #committee found issues like
	- **Lack of resources**
	- **Inadequate staff strength**
	- **Absence of expert advisers**
5. **Only recommendatory role** with **no means to enforce**

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. **Venkatchaliah Commission (2000)** #committee noted that **single committee encompassed too many functions** and recommended establishing **3 new committees:**
	- ***Constitution committee***
	- ***National Economy committee***
	- ***Legislation committee***
2. The commission also recommended **automatic-transfer** of bills to committees, on the line of the ***UK's model***, where all bills except money bills are automatically transferred to committees
3. **Research funds** should be allocated to parliamentary committees. On the line of ***Canada's model***, the library of Parliament can provide research-staff to the committees
4. As per **NCRWC**, **all reports of the committees** must be **compulsorily discussed in Parliament**.
5. **Live streaming** of committee meetings on line of **US'd model** where hearings are live streamed

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b>
> #Quote ***"Congress in session is congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee-rooms in Congress at work"***    - Woodrow Wilson

> #Quote ***“Parliamentary committees are devices to overcome the limitations of organisational and technical complexity of large legislatures. Independent India inherited the modern committee system from the British parliamentary system and innovated new techniques to effectively manage the voluminous tasks in the large Parliament.”***
