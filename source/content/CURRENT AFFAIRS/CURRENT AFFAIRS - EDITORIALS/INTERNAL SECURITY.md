### **DRONE WARFARE**
#GS3 #Drones 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- **Operation Sindoor** and use of Turkish **Asisguard drones** by Pakistan.
- Ukraine's **Operation Spider's web** using **FPV Drones** against Russia.
- **Historical context of drone warfare:** Modern military use of UAVs started in 1990s with the **Gulf War of 1991**. The **Nagarno-Karabakh conflict of 2020** marked turning point in drone warfare. They have been used effectively by **Yemeni Houtihs**, **HAMS** and **Hezbollah**.

<b><u>QUOTE</u></b>:
- ***"While we pursue our quest for niche technologies, including AI, it would be prudent to remember that future wars will also involve low technology, which is easy to obtain but difficult to defeat."*** - General MN Naravane, in context of the above two events.
- ***"A $1000 drone damaging a $200 million aircraft is our new reality"*** - Air Marshal Anil Chopra on Ukraine's Operation Spider's web

<b><u>DATA:</u></b> Global military drone market stood at **$14.14 billion** in 2023, and is projected to hit **$47.16 billion** by 2032.

<b><u>CONCERNS:</u></b>
1. UAVs are **cheap**, **customizable**, **difficult to track** and very **versatile** - coming in various forms and sizes. From Kamikazi (Loiterring munitions) to FPV drones, etc.
2. **Cheap** way to **locate air-defence** infrastructure, by **inviting interception** -> cheaper and easier way for **air domain intelligence** by the adversary.
3. Concern of **Swarm drones:**
	- More **resilient** than traditional drones - even if one is intercepted others can continuous autonomously or semi-autonomously.
	- Can easily **saturate air-defenses** allowing intelligence collection and attacking high value targets
	- **Lethal Autonomous Drone Swarms** with capabilities to perform complex manoeuvres.
	- Single drones can be jammed easily but, swarms are a challenge to intercept.
		>***"Now we have drones as small as water bottles - and in swarms, which are undetectable and untargetable"*** - CDS Gen. Anil Chaudhary
4. **Cost asymmetry:** is the central challenge as cheap drones can damage expensive assets and even countering drone threats is quiet expensive.

<b><u>COUNTERING DRONE THREATS:</u></b>
1. **DETECTION:** through mix of **AESA radars**, **electro-optical and infrared sensors**, **acoustic detectors** and **AI powered fusion systems**.
2. **INTERCEPTION:** through **kinetic** and **non-kinetic** means:
	- **Kinetic means:** 
		- <b><u>Surface-to-air missiles</u></b>(SAMs): but, they are costly and not that effective against drone swarms.
		- <b><u>Automated gun systems:</u></b> such as **C-RAM** and **Phalanx**, which target autonomously.
		- <b><u>Interceptor drones & nets:</u></b> for close-range neutralization, protecting critical assets
	- **Non-kinetic means:**
		- <b><u>Direct Energy Weapons (DEWs):</u></b> Lasers** and **microwave pulses** that disable drone by damaging sensors or frying electronics
		- <b><u>Electronic Warfare (EW):</u></b> **Jamming GPS signals** or communication links
		- <b><u>Spoofing:</u></b> misleading drone about their location or issuing false commands
		- <b><u>Cyber attacks:</u></b> taking control of drones and crashing them by exploiting software vulnerabilities
	- **Unconventional means:** Indian Army trained a black Kite, **"Arjun"** to take down drones on Indo-China border.
3. **INTEGRATION OF SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT:** Intelligence setup, even the local police matters. Even a traffic constable can make a difference.
4. **STRATEGIC THINKING & INVENTORY MANAGEMENT**: to safeguard assets from Ukraine like attacks.

<b><u>INDIAN ANTI-DRONE CAPABILITIES:</u></b>
1. <b><u>Akashteer Air Defence Control System:</u></b> developed by BEL and it integrated with Indian Air Force's integrated command network for real-time tracking.
2. <b><u>Bhargavastra:</u></b> fires **64 micro-rockets** in salvos to eliminate drone swarms.
3. <b><u>DRDO's Anti-Drone System:</u></b> offering **360 degree radar coverage** with both **jamming (soft kill)** and **laser (hard kill)** capabilities.
4. <b><u>Idrajaal:</u></b> AI-powered grid from a Hyderabad startup that combines jammers, spoofers and intelligence to protect up to 4,000 sq. km.
5. <b><u>IAF's Integrated Counter-UAS:</u></b> activated against Pakistani drone swarms.

<b><u>GLOBAL EXAMPLES:</u></b>
- Israel's Iron Dome
- **USA's Directed Energy M-SHORAD**

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> 
>***"We are at a cusp where war may be between humans and machines - and tomorrow, between machines themselves, Machines that are autonomous, intelligent, and make decisions. We may need a layered and resilient defence system to counter this."*** - CSD Chauhan

### **GLOBAL MILITARY SPENDING**
#GS3 #InternalSecurity #Defence #GS2 #IR 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **SIPRI 2025** report highlights that **global defence spending** in **2024** increased by **9.4% y-o-y** surpassing **UDS 2.7 Trillion** with **1/5th** coming from **Asia** and **Oceania**.
- The **5 largest military spenders** combined accounted for **61% of global defence expenditure**:

| **RANK** | **ICOUNTRY** | **MILITARY EXPENDITURE (2024)** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1        | USA          | USD 997 Billion                 |
| 2        | CHINA        | USD 314 Billion                 |
| 3        | RUSSIA       | USD 149 Billion                 |
| 4        | GERMANY      | USD 86.5 Billion                |
| 5        | INDIA        | USD 86.1 Billion                |

<b><u>REASONS FOR INCREASING MILITARISATION:</u></b>
1. **Nuclear posturing:** increasing nuclear warheads in South Asia with modernisation efforts ongoing
2. **Territorial and maritime disputes:** South China Sea is the hotbed of emerging disputes driven by China's *Nine Dash Line*.
	- *Cartographic agression* by China
3. **Deterrence by denial:** *new arms race* of developing submarine fleets, surveillance networks and air defence systems, rather than **deterrence by punishment**
4. **Securitisation of the commons:** in areas like *seabed mapping, underseal cabels, marine biodiversity* - blurring line between peace-time preparations and war-time readiness
5. **Lack of treaties and confidence building measures:** exacerbating the militarisation

<b><u>CONCLUSION/ WAY-FORWARD:</u></b> 
>***"Although modernisation and deterrence can promote security, the absence of clear military doctrines, effective arms control frameworks, and reliable confidence-building channels increases the risk of accidental escalation".***

### **PROLIFERATION EVASION AND SANCTIONS EVASION**
#GS3 #InternalSecurity #FATF #Terrorism #Report #MainsValueAddition 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- **FATF (Financial Action Task Force)** released ***Complex Proliferation Financing and Sanctions Evasion Schemes Report*** highlighting major vulnerabilities across the global financial system in **countering the Proliferation Financing (PF)**

<b><u>DEFINITION</u></b>
- <b><u>Proliferation Financing (PF)</u></b> involves raising, moving or making available funds, other assets or resources to persons or entities for the purposes of ***Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)***, posing a serious threat to global security and international financial system.

<b><u>FINDINGS OF THE REPORT/ISSUES:</u></b>
- **Global Risks:**
	- Risk environment is characterized by *state and non-state actors* acquiring and/or sourcing *dual-use goods, technology, and knowledge* through the use of *procurement networks*.
- **Global Gaps:**
	- Only **16% countries effectively implement targeted UN sanctions** to stop WMD proliferation
- **Techniques used bu Illicit actors:**
	1. **Use of intermediaries to evade sanctions:** *Procurement Networks* use *front/shell companies*, financial facilitators, and *third-country routes* to hide end-users.
	2. **Concealing ownership:** *Falsifying beneficial ownership* obscures true parties, especially through *digital means*, complicating detection.
	3. **Using virtual assets:** Sanctioned actors exploit *virtual currencies and new technologies* to bypass sanctions, moving funds directly or through *non-compliant countries*.
	4. **Exploiting Maritime sector:** including ***"dark fleet"*** #MainsValueAddition, is exploited to *disguise vessels* and evade sanctions.
			- #Eg Indian investigators confirmed a *mis-declared dual-use* equipment on a Pakistan-bound ship

<b><u>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT TO COUNTER PF:</u></b>
1. Regularly **update threat assessments** to keep pace with evolving **PF tactics**
2. **Enhance information sharing** to strengthen public and private sector's ability to **detect PF** and/or **sanctions evasion**.
3. **Add a WMD PF definition** to the **FATF Glossary** within five years to improve global coordination.
4. Conduct a **global review of PF risk assessments** within 3 years to **identify best practices** and strengthen responses.

### **SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT** #Quote 

- China recently published a whitepaper on ***"National Security in the 'New Era'"*** which mentions that,
	>***"development and security are like two wings of one body"***.
- It reads like testament on the importance of maintaining scientific and technological security at all times, and the importance of ensuring maintainability of supply chains.
- **Some recommendations for India post Operation Sindoor:**
	- **CONTEXT:** ***Emergence of a world which is more influenced by 'hard power' over 'soft power'***
		- India's new approach must take this in account
	- In depth study of India's defence capabilities on lines of what UK did after Russia-Ukraine conflict
	- ***National Armament System***
	- New ***Cyber and Electromagnetic Command*** to oversee networks and electromagnetic warfare
	- India must also reassess it's *"neutral"* stance on Israel-Iran conflict and it's growing relation with Israel. Israel must not become an ***"albatross around India's neck"***.

### **TERROR FINANCING**
#GS3 #InternalSecurity #Terrorism #Report 

 <b><u>NEWS:</u></b> ***"Comprehensive update on Terrorist Financing Risks"*** report was recently released by **FATF** revealing terrorist organizations's persistent ability to exploit the **international financial system** to support their activites.

<b><u>KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING TERRORIST FINANCING RISKS:</u></b> 
1. **Lone actors** and **small cells** requiring **minimal funding**
2. **Porous borders** in *Africa* and *South Asia*
3. **State sponsorship** of terrorism
4. **Free Trade Zones** with week regulations

<b><u>TRENDS IN TERRORIST FINANCING:</u></b>
- **Conventional methods:** ***Cash-based transactions, Hawala*** and other informal hard-to-trace methods used by groups like ***Al-Shabaab*** and ***Hamas***, etc.
- **Emerging methods:**
	- **Digital platforms:** ***Social media, Crowdfunding, Online marketplaces*** are exploited for fundraising, ***Virtual assets like BitCoin, Online Gaming platforms*** for fund transfers, etc.
	- **Criminal activities:** ***Extortion, Kidnapping for ransom (KFR), drug trafficking, anf illicit trade in natural resources (glod, timber, etc.)*** by groups like ***Boko Haram***, etc.
	- **Use of non-profit and legal entities:** Use of ***Front and shell companies*** used to obscure terrorist funding activities, ***diversion of funds from non-profit organizations***, etc.

<b><u>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING (CTF) STRATEGIES:</u></b>
1. **Identify risk indicators:** frequent transfers to *high-risk jurisdictions,* use of *anonymity-enhancing tools* like *virtual assets* and *prepaid cards,* etc.
2. **Coordinated multilateral response:** to address transnational dimension of terrorist-financing - this involves *multilateral designation of terrorist organizations* under *UNSC sanctions.*
3. **Outreach to sectors not covered under FATF standards:** develop targeted *PPPs* to better understand and address *threats* from *social media* and *messaging platforms.*

### **SUBMARINE CABLES**
#GS2 #GS3 #IR #InternalSecurity 

<b><u>DATA/ INTRO:</u></b>
- Submarine cables carry **99% of global internet traffic** and drives economic and societal growth. Following their own *Moore's law, **cable capacity doubles every 2-2.5 years*** with **70,000-100,000 Km added annually** and **USD 10 Billions** in **investments**.

<b><u>FEATURE OF THE SUBMARINE CABLES SECTOR AND CHALLENGES:</u></b>
1. Driven by **private players** and gown in haphazard manner with **extremely vulnerable dense clusters at choke-points** like ***Luzon strait** and the **Strait of Malacca.***
2. **Lack of formal regulation** leading to serious gaps in **cable governance.**

<b><u>THREATS TO SUBMARINE CABLES?</u></b>
1. **Accidental damage**
2. **Sabotage:** recently a **Chinese-owned vessel, *Shunxing-36*, cut  undersea cables near Taiwan's Kee-lung harbour.**
3. **Tapping of cables** using *splice chambers* and *optical splitters* -  **Snowden leaks***

<b><u>IMPORTANCE FOR INDIA:</u></b>
1. **India's exploding data needs** require extensive undersea cable networks.
2. **Global strategic shift** redefining undersea cables from *commercial infrastructure* to  **assets critical to sovereignty and global influence**.
	- Traditional **US domination**, bur growing **Chinese influence** through **Belt and Road Initiative** - ***Digital Silk Road***
	- **USA, EU & Japan** pushing for a ***"clean cable" consortium.***
3. **Pakistan and China axis** as China is connecting Pakistan to West Asia
4. **China** using **submarine cable attacks** as part of its **gray-zone warfare**: #Eg ***Shunxing-36 and Taiwan***
5. **Dependence on foreign ships for repair:** there is **Chinese** dominance in **submarine cable repair** sector - China operates now around 6 **undersea cable repair vessels**, with at least one linked to *PLA*. **India has only 1 privately owned submarine cable repair vessel.**

<b><u>HOW INDIA CAN FORTIFY IT'S UNDERSEA CABLES:</u></b>
1. India should **expand its submarine cable repair capacity** through a **public sector shipyard**. This is to enhance **national security** and **counter China** by offering **regional alternative to China**
2. **Continuous monitoring on critical routes** is required to address the threat of **tapping**, along with development of **advanced underwater domain awareness** including **sensors and unmanned vehicles**. India must **fast-track procurement** of indigenous technologies already in various stages of **iDEX initiative**.
3. **Enacting laws** to **protect submarine cables in India's EEZ** on the lines of **USA**
	- In **USA** laws require entities to obtain **formal permission** to *lay submarine cables, establish no-activity buffer zones,* and *impose penalties* for violations within EEZ.
4. India still does not has an **international maritime policy**. It must develop such a policy focused on developing its own means to protect submarine cables in high seas. This includes **monitoring suspect vessels** particularly, *Chinese survey ships* - using **space** and **naval assets**
5. India must work with **private sector** to develop **tamper-proof cables** and must **bury them deeper** and ensure **strong encryption**, with close cooperation in **friendly countries** particularly the **QUAD**.
6. To prevent **sabotage**, India must build **redundancies and alternative submarine cable routes**. The submarine cables must be **formally designated** as **critical infrastructure** under the **NCIIPC**.
7. India's **National Marine Security Coordinator** cloud lead the creation of a **National Submarine Cable Security Framework** bringing together all stakeholders - ISRO, Indian Nay, Indian Coast Guards, NCIIPC, and private cable operators.

<b><u>GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF SUBMARINE CABLES:</u></b>
1. **UNCLOS** allows all states to lay cabled and requires them to criminalize intentional or negligent damage by their nationals or flagged vessels, and to cooperate in enforcement. But **enforcement is left to flag states**.
2. **International Telecommunication Union (ITU):** focuses on **technical standards** and **guidance** but **no regulation** for cable laying and safe zones.
3. **International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)** under **ITU** provides **best practices** and **criteria** for cable protection zones. But it is **advisory**.

<b><u>CONSLUSION:</u></b>
> ***In today's world, protecting submarine cables is not just about keeping the internet running - it's about keeping the nation standing. Guarding them isn't just a good policy, it's guarding the backbone of sovereignty and strategy in a connected world.***
