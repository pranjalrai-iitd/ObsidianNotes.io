### **CHINESE DAMS ON BRAHMAPUTRA**
#GS2 #WaterDiplomacy #China

<u><b>NEWS:</b></u>
- China proposed the **Medog Hydropower Project** near the *"great bend"* of the Brahmaputra river which will be **world's largest hydropower facility** (three times the current largest 3 Gorges Dam of China)
- **MoU on sharing hydrological data for Brahmaputra river** expired in 2023 and no data has been shared by China since 2022
- China's **South-North Water Diversion(SNWD) plan** is rumored to include diversion of water from Yarlung Tsangpo to arid northern regions.

<b><u>DATA: BRAHMAPUTRA AND INDIA</u></b>
- India covers **34%** of Brahmaputra basin but, contributes over **80%** of its total water yield. Thus, <u><i>"India is river's major source"</i></u>. This is because:
	- <u>Climatic differences yield disparity:</u> Tibetan plateau receives lesser rainfall compared to India's portion.
	- <u>Tributaries and Monsoon boost Indian contribution:</u> most water during the Mosoon. Further, snowmelt tributaries from India/Nepal.
- Brahmaputra holds **30% of India's total water resources** and **41% of India's total Hydroelectric potential** - ***Central Water Commission***

<b><u>IMPACT OF UPSTREAM INTERVENTIONS BY CHINA:</u></b>
1. **Seasonal flow variations pose challenges**: to hydro-projects like on the **Siang**, especially during the dry season or peak demand season.
2. **Risk of sudden flooding events**:resulting from reservoir mismanagement, dam failure, landslides or seismic activities.
3. **Ecological implication**: alterations in natural flow can affect river morphology, impacting aquatic ecosystems along the Brahmaputra.

<b><u>WHAT CAN INDIA DO?:</u></b>
- **Hydropower development focused in Arunachal Pradesh** with focus on **strategic mitigation through storage projects**:
	- Manage flow variability by building storage infrastructure like the <b><u>Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP)</u></b> for dual purpose of *energy generation* and *flow regulation*.
- **Inter-basin water transfer proposals:** linking Brahmaputra basin to water-scarce regions of the Ganga basin:
	1. **Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganga link**
	2. **Jogighopa-Teesta-Farakka link**
- However, **No major threat from upstream Chinese projects** due to substantial rainfall, monsoon-fed tributaries and snowmelt in Indian tributaries.

<b><u>INDIA'S STRATEGIC APPROACH ON BRAHMAPUTRA ISSUE:</u></b>
- **Strengthen scientific assessment and monitoring** to study implications of upstreams interventions.
- **Enhance diplomatic engagement** to **renew MoU on hydrological data sharing** with China.
- **Build strategic buffer projects to regulate flow**.
