### **NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR NET ZERO VIKSIT BHARAT**
#GS3 #Nuclear

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- Union Budget 2025-26 launched a **Nuclear Energy Mission** focused on R&D of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government aims to build **at lest 5 SMRs by 2033**.
- GoI set a target of **100 GW nuclear power by 2047**.
<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- India aims to become developed by 2047 and achieve net-zero by 2070. This dual goal demands a projected **clean energy need of 28,000 TWh annually** from the current **9,800 TWh** of which 96% comes from fossil fuels.
- Out of 28,000 TWh about **20,000 TWh** will have to come from Nuclear power. **Clean energy** needs to increase **70 times** and around **70%** of it needs to come from **nuclear** in 45 years.

<b><u>INDIA'S 3 STAGE NUCLEAR PROGRAM:</u></b>
1. **First-stage:** ***PHWRs*** grown due to foreign uranium
	- PHWRs form the foundation for scalablr, domestically-driven nuclear capacity expansion under the **100 GWe mission by 2047**
2. **Second-stage:** ***FBRs***, yet to take off
	- FBRs enable **60-70 times more energy** from the same quantity of mined fuel
	- <b><u>NEWS:</u></b> ***Kalpakkam*** FRB was inaugurated by PM in 2024
3. **Third-stage:** **Thorium** based **Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)**, remains developed.

<b><u>NUCLEAR FUEL SUPPLY:</u></b>
- **Uranium dependency:** 
	- 100 GWe capacity needs about **20,000 tons of Uranium/year**, which is approximately **15% of global production.
	- Focus should be on **domestic fuel development** and **fuel recycling**.
- **Role of HALEU and ANEEL fuel:
	- High Assay Low Enriched Uranium needed for PHWR Thorium use
	- ANEEL **(Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life)** fuel under development with **economic and safety advantages**

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. **Focus beyond the SMRs:** as SMRs would take at least two decades to mature before deployment and are unlikely to meet 2047 deadline. **R&D** must be **redirected** to **Thorium MSR** and **FBRs**.
2. **International cooperation:** for HALEU and ANEEL fuel from developing nations, like Central Asia.
3. 100 GWe mission should be seen as a **stepping stone, not a limit**. Nuclear energy in not optional, but central to net zero and development goals. **Multi-agency nuclear deployment** along with **strong R&D focus** on **micro-reactors**.
4. **International cooperation** with partners like **France**, which is a pioneer in civil nuclear energy with 70% of it's electricity derived from nuclear.

### **GEOTHERMAL ENERGY**
#GS3 #Economy #Energy #Infrastructure 

<b><u>NEWS/ DEFINITION/ DATA:</u></b>
- **Uttarakhand** approved the ***Uttarakhand Geo-Thermal Energy Policy 2025***, which aims to promote scientific and technological research to explore and develop economically and environmentally viable geothermal resources.
- #Definition Geothermal energy  refers to the thermal (heat) energy **derived from the Earth's subsurface**. This energy is due to:
	- Partly **residual heat** generated *during Earth's formation*
	- Partly from **continuous and spontaneous radioactive decay** or **naturally occurring isotopes** within the Earth's core and mantle
- #Data **Geothermal Atlas of India 2022** **estimates potential** of ***10.6 GW*** in India

<b><u>MAJOR GEOTHERMAL SPOTS IN INDIA:</u></b>
1. **NW-SE Himalayan Arc:** *Puga, Manikaran*
	- ***Puga*** and ***Chumathang*** in **Ladakh** are most promising geothermal fields in India
2. **West Coast Continental margin:** *Dholera, Ganeshpuri*
3. **Son-Narmada-Tapi linement:** *Sonata, Surajkand, Godavari Basin*
<p align="center"><img src="https://d2av8kbir6lh9m.cloudfront.net/uploads/ZgxgjI97iPnVToAt5bvBpvLzA80OIQfUgi5o6fXz.jpg" alt="Geothermal Spots in India" width="500"/></p>

<b><u>EXTRACTING GEOTHERMAL ENERGY:</u></b> It can be **extracted** using ***geothermal technology*** for *heating and cooling, electricity generation* and *energy storage*
1. **Conventional Geothermal Technologies:** exploit **hydrothermal reservoirs** where geothermal heat is carried to the surface by **naturally occurring subsurface fluids***
2. **Next-Generation Geothermal technologies:** harvest heat at **greater depths** by **circulating a fluid from the surface** through engineered systems and as **hydrothermal reservoir independent**. These include, 
	- **Enhance Geothermal Systems (EGSs)**, and
	- **Close-Loop Geothermal Systems (CLGSs)**

<b><u>BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY:</u></b>

| **BENEFITS**                                                                                                   | **CHALLENGES**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Around the clock electricity generation<br>- High utilization rate - **over 75% in 2023**<br>- Low emissions | - Relatively high technology cost<br>- Limited R&D<br>- Environmental concerns<br>- Licensing processes, etc. |

<b><u>INDIA'S INITATIVES:</u></b>
- ***Geothermal Atlas of India, 2022*** mapping geothermal potential
- ***Constitution of Task Force*** to harness Geothermal Energy in India
- ***Renewable Energy Research and Technology Development Programme (RE-RTD)*** for research in new geothermal technologies
- **International cooperation:** with
	- **Iceland** and **Saudi Arabia**
