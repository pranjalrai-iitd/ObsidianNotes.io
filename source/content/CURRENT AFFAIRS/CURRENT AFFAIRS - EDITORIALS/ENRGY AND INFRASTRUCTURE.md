### NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR NET ZERO VIKSIT BHARAT
#GS3 #Nuclear

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- Union Budget 2025-26 launched a **Nuclear Energy Mission** focused on R&D of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government aims to build **at lest 5 SMRs by 2033**.
- GoI set a target of **100 GW nuclear power by 2047**.
<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- India aims to become developed by 2047 and achieve net-zero by 2070. This dual goal demands a projected **clean energy need of 28,000 TWh annually** from the current **9,800 TWh** of which 96% comes from fossil fuels.
- Out of 28,000 TWh about **20,000 TWh** will have to come from Nuclear power. **Clean energy** needs to increase **70 times** and around **70%** of it needs to come from **nuclear** in 45 years.

<b><u>INDIA'S 3 STAGE NUCLEAR PROGRAM:</u></b>
1. **First-stage:** ***PHWRs*** grown due to foreign uranium
	- PHWRs form the foundation for scalablr, domestically-driven nuclear capacity expansion under the **100 GWe mission by 2047**
2. **Second-stage:** ***FBRs***, yet to take off
	- FBRs enable **60-70 times more energy** from the same quantity of mined fuel
	- <b><u>NEWS:</u></b> ***Kalpakkam*** FRB was inaugurated by PM in 2024
3. **Third-stage:** **Thorium** based **Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)**, remains developed.

<b><u>NUCLEAR FUEL SUPPLY:</u></b>
- **Uranium dependency:** 
	- 100 GWe capacity needs about **20,000 tons of Uranium/year**, which is approximately **15% of global production.
	- Focus should be on **domestic fuel development** and **fuel recycling**.
- **Role of HALEU and ANEEL fuel:
	- High Assay Low Enriched Uranium needed for PHWR Thorium use
	- ANEEL **(Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life)** fuel under development with **economic and safety advantages**

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. **Focus beyond the SMRs:** as SMRs would take at least two decades to mature before deployment and are unlikely to meet 2047 deadline. **R&D** must be **redirected** to **Thorium MSR** and **FBRs**.
2. **International cooperation:** for HALEU and ANEEL fuel from developing nations, like Central Asia.
3. 100 GWe mission should be seen as a **stepping stone, not a limit**. Nuclear energy in not optional, but central to net zero and development goals. **Multi-agency nuclear deployment** along with **strong R&D focus** on **micro-reactors**.
4. **International cooperation** with partners like **France**, which is a pioneer in civil nuclear energy with 70% of it's electricity derived from nuclear.
