<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> 
- **Parliamentary Select Committee** presents a report on the **Income Tax Bill 2025**

<b><u>INCOME TAX BILL, 2025:</u></b> seeks to replace the **Income-Tax Act, 1961** and aims to **simplify the language** and **remove redundant provisions** of the Act.
1. **Reduce volume:** The bill removes *283 sections* and *24 chapters* from the existing 1961 Act
2. **Language simplification:** Introduction of *"tax year"* instead of the existing terminologies like *"financial year"* and *"assessment year"*
3. **Undisclosed income from Virtual Digital Assets:** Defined *"virtual digital asset"* and *"electronic mode"* along with the provisions on their taxation
4. **Power to frame schemes:** Empower *central government* to frame new schemes for greater efficiency, transparency, and accountability. The schemes must be laid before Parliament.
5. **Virtual digital space:** Allows authorities to gain access of a virtual digital space during search and seizure proceedings.
	- It is over the existing provision to gain access to physical space - like breaking locks etc.   
	- *Virtual digital space* include *email servers, social media accounts, online investment and trading accounts, websites,* etc.
6. **Dispute resolution panel:** assessing officers must necessarily issue directions along with the points of determination and the reasons for arriving at the decision
7. **Interpretation of tax treaties:** If a term in a treaty is not defined in the treaty, the Act, or notification by the central government, its meaning will be assigned in any other central law

<b><u>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE:</u></b> to *modernise India's tax code* while ensuring fairness, transparency, and fewer disputes
1. **Upheld the powers of tax officials under the new IT Bill:** the bill has provisions for access, forcibly if necessary, the social media and private emails in search and seizure operations
2. **Updating definitions:** aligning definitions of *"capital asset"*, *"infrastructure capital company"*, and *"micro and small enterprises"* with current laws
3. **Business and startup support:** clearer *R&D deduction rules*, *tax breaks for biodegradable waste handling businesses*, and clarity on *"parent company"* and *"status"* definitions in tax appeals
