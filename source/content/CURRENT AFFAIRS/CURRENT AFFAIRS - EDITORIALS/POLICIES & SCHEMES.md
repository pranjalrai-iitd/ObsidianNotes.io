### **INDIA'S EV LOCALISATION POLICY**
#GS3 #EVs #Environment 
<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> **Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI)** notified guidelines of the scheme to promote manufacturing of electric passenger cars in India
<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- FADA data for FY25:
	- **EVs** -> **7.8% of total vehicle sales in India**
		- 3 wheelers - 57%
		- 2 wheelers - 6.1%
		- Passenger vehicles - 2.6%
		- Commercial vehicles - 0.9%
- **IEA** identified India as the **largest global market for electric three-wheelers** in 2024 
- As per **Rhodium group**, India will be **4th largest electric car market by 2030** and it must cut cost to compete with China
<b><u>PROVISIONS</u></b>:
- Sharp **reduction** in **customs duty** on **completely built units (CBU)** of electric cars, from the current 70-100% to **15%**.
	- Duty cut applies to vehicles above $35,000 ~ Rs.30 lakhs
	- Contingent on **investing a minimum of Rs.4,150 Cr ~ $500 Mn** in India over **3 years**.
	- Investments must lead to **Domestic value addition (DVA)** of at least **25%** within 3 years, increasing to 50% by the 5th year.
	- Maximum 8,000 vehicles can be imported annually and total foregone customs duty is capped at Rs.6484 Cr.
- MHI estimates that the scheme would incur a **landing cost of Rs, 36 lakh**, significantly lower than before.
<b><u>CONCERNS:</u></b>
- Dilution of India's domestic manufacturing if foreign firms are compelled to transfer core technologies
- Indigenous EV ecosystem like that of China and Vietnam, might not boom.
- Mass adoption not addressed, as even after duty reduction prices are way higher than of ICE vehicles.
<b><u>WAY FORWARD</u></b>:
- Re-orientation towards boosting domestic capacity with investments in research institutes, encourage public sector participation and fund startups.
- Other view is to allow even a liberal policy so that the inflow of the state of the art EV technology can nudge domestic manufacturers to focus on R&D and technological upgradation.
