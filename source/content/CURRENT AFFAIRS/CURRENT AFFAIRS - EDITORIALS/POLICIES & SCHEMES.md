### **INDIA'S EV LOCALISATION POLICY**
#GS3 #EVs #Environment 
<b><u>NEWS:</u></b> **Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI)** notified guidelines of the scheme to promote manufacturing of electric passenger cars in India
<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- FADA data for FY25:
	- **EVs** -> **7.8% of total vehicle sales in India**
		- 3 wheelers - 57%
		- 2 wheelers - 6.1%
		- Passenger vehicles - 2.6%
		- Commercial vehicles - 0.9%
- **IEA** identified India as the **largest global market for electric three-wheelers** in 2024 
- As per **Rhodium group**, India will be **4th largest electric car market by 2030** and it must cut cost to compete with China
<b><u>PROVISIONS</u></b>:
- Sharp **reduction** in **customs duty** on **completely built units (CBU)** of electric cars, from the current 70-100% to **15%**.
	- Duty cut applies to vehicles above $35,000 ~ Rs.30 lakhs
	- Contingent on **investing a minimum of Rs.4,150 Cr ~ $500 Mn** in India over **3 years**.
	- Investments must lead to **Domestic value addition (DVA)** of at least **25%** within 3 years, increasing to 50% by the 5th year.
	- Maximum 8,000 vehicles can be imported annually and total foregone customs duty is capped at Rs.6484 Cr.
- MHI estimates that the scheme would incur a **landing cost of Rs, 36 lakh**, significantly lower than before.
<b><u>CONCERNS:</u></b>
- Dilution of India's domestic manufacturing if foreign firms are compelled to transfer core technologies
- Indigenous EV ecosystem like that of China and Vietnam, might not boom.
- Mass adoption not addressed, as even after duty reduction prices are way higher than of ICE vehicles.
<b><u>WAY FORWARD</u></b>:
- Re-orientation towards boosting domestic capacity with investments in research institutes, encourage public sector participation and fund startups.
- Other view is to allow even a liberal policy so that the inflow of the state of the art EV technology can nudge domestic manufacturers to focus on R&D and technological upgradation.

### **KHELO BHARAT NITI 2025**
#GS2 #Governance #Sports #Policy #Scheme 

<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- Union cabinet approved the **National Sports Policy 2025** replacing the earlier policy that was made in 2001, with an aim of **transforming India as a global sporting powerhouse** and hosting the **2036 Olympic Games.**

<b><u>FIVE PILLARS OF KHELO BHARAT NITI 2025</u></b>
1. <b><u>Excellence on global stage</u></b> through strengthening of sports programs from *grassroots to elite levels*, enhance capacity and governance of the **National Sports Federation**, and building **sports infrastructure**, etc.
2. <b><u>Sports for Economic Development:</u></b> Promoting the **economic potential** of sports through **sports tourism**, promoting **Start up and entrepreneurship**, encouraging **PPP and CSR** through initiatives like ***"One Corporate-One Sport"*** and ***"Adopt an Athlete"***.
3. <b><u>Sports for Social Development:</u></b> ensuring **social inclusion** through the participation of **women** and **weaker sections**, recognition of **para-sports**, etc.
4. <b><u>Sports a People's Movement:</u></b> driving **mass participation**, promoting a **culture of fitness** and universal access to sports facilities, etc.
5. <b><u>Integration with National Education Policy 2020:</u></b> by **integrating sports into school curricula** with specialized training for teachers, etc.

<b><u>STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR KBN 2025:</u></b>
-  **Governance:** through a **robust regulatory framework** including a legal framework
- **Private sector funding & support:** innovative mechanisms like **PPP** and **CSR**
- Leveraging **emerging technologies** including AI and data analytics and creating a **National Level Monitoring Framework**, etc.

<b><u>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPORTS SECTOR:</u></b>
1. Assert India's **soft power** and regional aspirations
2. Establish India as a **global sporting powerhouse**, and a strong contender for **2036 Olympic Games**
3. Reap country's **favorable demographic dividend** aligning with the principles of *Viksit Bharat*

<b><u>DEFICIENCIES OF THE SPORTS POLICY</u></b>
1. **Inclusion without accountability:** no quotas or targets are there to increase female participation in governance, coaching or competitions.
	- **Australia mandates all its national sports bodies receiving public funds must ensure 50% gender representation on boards by 2027**.
2. Policy treats **disability as a parallel track, not an integrated one** - still no mandate for **inclusive Physical Education in schools** and no ***universal infrastructure design mandate*** as ratified in the **UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRDP).**
3. Policy refers to **underrepresented groups** but there is **no explicit acknowledgement of transgender and non-binary athletes**.
4. **No independent oversight body** to monitor inclusion across federations.

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. **Set enforceable targets** for **inclusion goals** - include **women** in boards and condition funding on achievement of the goals.
2. Build **universal infrastructure designs** where **para-sports governance & training** is integrated with traditional sports.
3. Recognize, **transgender athletes**
4. Form an **independent oversight body** to **monitor inclusion** across federations

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b>
>***To fulfill India's vision of "sports for all", the policy must treat inclusion not as a soft value, but a legal and structural commitment.*** *India's global aspirations must begin with fairness at home for women, persons with disabilities, and gender-diverse individuals.*
