### **CROSS-BORDER CULTURE:**
#Anecdote
- During the **anti-ICE protests** in **Los Angeles**, Mexican flags were raised. Many interpreted this as an act of sedition as the state of California (with Los Angeles as its capital) was earlier a part of Mexico - USA captured California, from Mexico during the 1848 Mexican-American War. Raising foreign flags in principle is not a crime. However, during a protest supporting immigration, raising a flag of former state which controlled that territory might be a symbol of separation or rejection.
- Though, the above act of protesters raise an important question - *"Can the historical cultural contact outweigh modern borders?"*
- A Mexican journalist described the protests in the light of the above question. He wrote in the Washington Post, *"It's about refusing to be erased.... The Mexican identity isn't foreign (in Los Angeles). It's foundational."* He further added, 
	>***"Culture, street names, food and families never crossed the border because the border crossed them."*** 
- The flags, according to him were not a symbol of separation or rejection. They, reflected a layered sense of identity - of being both American and Mexican.
