	- Whenever the office of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker becomes vacant, the house shall **choose another member** to fill the position.
- ***Article 178*** has similar provisions for Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the legislative assembly of the states.

<b><u>Term of Deputy Speaker, Vacation of office, and Disqualification:</u></b> #Prelims 
- Once elected, a deputy speaker usually **continues in office until the dissolution of the house**. However, the speaker continues till the **new Lok Sabha is elected**.
- Speaker or deputy speaker **vacates** her office if she **ceases to be a member** of the house.
- They may also **resign** or may be **removed from the office** by resolution of the House of the People passed by a **majority of all the then members of the house (1/2 of total strength - vacancies)**

<b><u>Disqualification provisions of MPs:</u></b> #Prelims are still valid of Speaker/Deputy Speaker except **one exception**
- Para-5 of the **tenth schedule** says that a person who has been elected **speaker/deputy speaker** *shall not be disqualified if she, by reason of her election to that office, **voluntarily gives up the membership of the political party** to which she belonged **immediately before such election** - and doesn't, **so long as she continues to hold officer** thereafter rejoin that political party or become a member of another political party*.
- **NOTE:** this exception also applies to **Vice chairperson of Rajya Sabha, Speaker/Deputy Speaker of legislative assembly** and Chairman/Deputy Chairman of Legislative Council.

<b><u>Functions of Deputy Speaker:</u></b> #Prelims 
- Deputy Speaker is a **Presiding Officer**
	- **Article 95(1)** says that when the office of **speaker is vacant**, the **duties** of the office shall be performed by the **Deputy Speaker**
- She is also **ex-officio chairperson of some committees** by the virtue of her position #Eg *House Budget Committee, Committee on Private Members Bill*, etc.
- In case of *joint sitting of the two houses* and *absence of speaker*, **Deputy Speaker presides over the joint sitting** of the two houses.

<b><u>Powers of Deputy Speaker:</u></b> #Prelims
- In general, the deputy speaker has the **same powers as the speaker** when presiding over a sitting of the house. *All references to the speaker in the rules are deemed to be references to the Deputy Speaker when he presides.*
- Further, **no appeal lies to the Speaker against a ruling given by Deputy Speaker** or any person presiding over a sitting of the House in the absence of Speaker.
- **NOTE:** ***Deputy Speaker is not subordinate to speaker*** - when he presides over a sitting, he has all the powers of a Speaker.

<b><u>Is it mandatory to elect a deputy speaker?</u></b>
- Constitutional experts point out that both **Article 93** and **Article 178** use the words ***"shall"*** and ***"as soon as may be"*** - *indicating that not only is the selection of Speaker and Deputy Speaker* **mandatory**, it must be **held at the earliest**.
- But since **Constitution doesn't clearly mention a time frame**, for making the appointments, it allows government to delay or avoid appointing a Deputy Speaker.

<b><u>Conventions which are being followed:</u></b>
- Generally, the practice in both LokSabha and the State Legislative Assemblies has been to *elect speaker during the (mostly short) first session* of the new House - *usually on the third day after oath-taking and affirmation take place* over the first two days.
	- The **election of deputy speaker** generally takes place in the **second session**, even though there is *no bar* in having the elections in the first session of the new LokSabha/Assembly. But the election of **deputy speaker** is usually *not delayed beyond the second session* without genuine and unavoidable constraints.
- Since, the term of **Morarji Desai government***, the tradition of the post of the Deputy Speaker going to the **Opposition party** has been followed.

<b><u>Why there has been no Deputy Speaker in the 17th LS and the currently ongoing 18th LS?</u></b>
- The ruling party wasn't able to agree on a **suitable opposition party member** for the post. Even, the opposition in the 17th LS didn't have the required numbers to choose their own person.
- **Speaker from the ruling party:** ***Rule 8*** of the ***Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha*** provides that the **election shall be held on such a date as the Speaker may fix**, and the Deputy Speaker is elected once a *motion proposing his name is carried*.

<b><u>Can courts intervene in situation of non-appointment of deputy speaker></u></b>
- **No precedent** and the constitution is silent
- Further, **Article 122(1)** says that **validity** of any proceedings in Parliament **shall not be questioned** on the **ground** of any **alleged irregularity of procedure**
- However, constitutional experts say that *courts do have jurisdiction to at least enquire why there has been no election to the post of Deputy Speaker*, since the constitution envisage an election, *"as soon as may be"*.

<b><u>SIGNIFICANCE OF DEPUTY SPEAKER:</u></b>
1. **Continuity of speaker's office** by acting as the *Speaker when the office becomes vacant* due to illness, death, resignation, or any other reasons.
2. **Presided over committees** such as *Committee on Private Member's Bill* and the *House Budget Committee* of the Parliament.
3. **Unlike the panel of chairpersons**, *appointed by speaker*, which comprise of **9 MPs** from various political parties, who preside over the house when the Speaker is not in the chair. however, *they don't enjoy the same constitutional or administrative power as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker*.
4. **Increased accountability of majority party** to some extent in the legislature, since the position of the Deputy Speaker by **convection is held by opposition party**.
5. **Prevents constitutional crisis:** if the speaker resigns, a severe constitutional crisis may surface which will be detrimental to the system of governance.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***The office of the deputy speaker foes beyond ceremonial significance and is indispensable for Parliamentary democracy. Thus, the appointment should be made as soon as possible.***

### 2. PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILLS #LevelUpCA 
#GS2 #Polity #Parliament #Bills 

<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b> 
- A Private Member Bill is a ***mechanism through which Members of Parliament, who are not ministers*, can propose a legislation.**
- In India's parliamentary system *most laws are introduced by the government.* They are *drafted by Ministries and tabled by the ministers*.
	- In contrast, **PMBs come from individual MPs**, both *ruling party or the Opposition.*
- Only **14 PMBs** have been passed by both houses, last passed in **1970**

<b><u>PROCESS OF INTRODUCING A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL:</u></b> #Prelims 
- **At least 1 month notice** has to be given by the member before introduction of a private member's bill
	- In this period, the *House secretariat examines the Constitutional compliance* and rules of legislation of the bill.
- The **admissibility** of a PMB is decided by the **Chairperson** in the case of Rajya Sabha and the **Speaker** in the case of Lok Sabha.
- They can be introduced in **either houses** of the Parliament and goes through *same process as a government bill*.
- **Lok Sabha** allocates **last 2.5 hours** on every **Friday** for consideration and discussion on the bill. **Rajya Sabha** does the same **every alternate Friday**.

<b><u>SIGNIFICANCE OF PRIVATE MEMBER's BILL:</u></b>
1. ***Encourages democratic expression:*** **allows members to play a part as an active legislator:**
	- PMBs have long provided *platform for MPs to introduce a pieces of legislation* that reflect *personal convixtions, constitutional demands, or emerging social needs*, **regardless of party affiliation**.
2. ***Policy incubators:*** **vehicles for forward looking and unconventional ideas:**
	- #Eg In 2014, ***Tiruchi Siva of DMK (Rajya Sabha)*** introduced the ***"Right of Transgender Person"*** Bill (and this was also passed by Rajya Sabha, but NOT by Lok Sabha).
		- it laid the *groundwork for the **Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019***.
	- #Eg In 2019, ***Congress MP Supriya Sule*** introduced the ***"Right to Disconnect Bill"*** for grating employees the *legal right to disengage from work-related communication beoynd official working hours.*
3. ***Draw attention of government*** on serious issues and *create awareness about them*.
	- The PMBs bring out the **"sense of house"** on important policy issues, which can be taken up by the government.
		- #Eg Before the voting age was reduced from 21 years to 18 years, there was a PMB which suggested such reform.
4. After the **enactment of anti-defection law**, the PMBs remain one of the *few avenues through which MPs* **across party lines can suggest** ***constructive policy alternatives***.

<b><u>Have Private Members bills ever been passed in the Parliament?</u></b>
- In *75 years of the history of Parliament*, **only 14 private members'** bills have become a law. No such bill has become a law since 1970.
- In the **17th LS (2019-2024), <b><u>729</u></b> PMBs** were introduced and <b><u>705</u></b> in **Rajya Sabha.**
	- However, **only <b><u>2</u></b> PMBs in LS** and, **only <b><u>14</u></b> in RS** were **discussed**.

<b><u>Impact of PMBs being ignored/eroded:</u></b> leads to ***procedural lapse*** and also indicates ***democratic backsliding***

<b><u>Reasons for PMB mechanism of passing law being ignored/eroded:</u></b>
1. Frequent **disruptions, pre-emptive adjournments**
2. increasing **prioritization of government business** - less time if given to PMBs
3. **Reducing intra-party democracy:** leads to MPs avoiding taking measures which party as a whole is not planning
4. **Timing issue:** many MPs skip the Friday sessions to return to their constituencies on the weekends.

<b><u>WAY FORWARD FOR PMBs:</u></b>
1. **Treat the time allocated for PMBs as sacrosanct:**
	- Rules of Procedure and conduct of business should be amended to *explicitly protect time being overridden*, except in case of national emergency.
2. **Midweek scheduling to discuss PMBs:** to increase attendance of MPs
3. Parliament should consider instituting a **review committee** specifically for PMBs, responsible for **screening bills** for *quality,relevance and constitutionality*.
	- It can even recommend a **priority list** for *discussion based on* **public importance** and **cross-country support**.
4. If the **government's business need more time**, ***extend the overall working hours of Parliament*** rather than encroaching upon the Fridays reserved for PMBs.
5. **Adopt international best practice like "<b><u><i>ten minute rule</i></u></b>" of UK parliament:** any MP can make a short speech of up to 10 minutes in support of a PMB along with its introduction after which another MP may oppose it for equal amount of time. 
	- This allows bills to be **introduced, heard, and recorded without long time slots***.
6. **Digital access and tracking:** an online platform can be created to have all the PMBs listed.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b>
- ***Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar has described PMBs as "<b><i><u>far-sighted, forward-looking, and a gold mine</u></i></b>" for India's legislative landscape. Therefore, it should not be allowed to be ignored***.
- The erosion of PMBs indicate a move towards ***centralization of legislative process*** which ***undermines deliberative democracy***. Therefore, it is important to bring reforms in the PMB process to restore ***participatory law making in parliamentary process***.
