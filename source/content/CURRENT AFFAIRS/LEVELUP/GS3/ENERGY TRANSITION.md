<b><u>NEWS:</u></b>
- The Union government notified the **guidelines** to **promote domestic manufacturing** of electric cars, offering a **concessional import duty of 15%** on completely built-up units.

<b><u>DATA:</u></b>
- According to **ESI 2021-22**, the **automotive industry** is expected to play a critical role in **transition towards green energy**
	- The **domestic electric vehicle (EV) market** is expected to **grow at CAGR of 49% between 2022 and 2030** and it expected to hit **1 crore unit sale by 2030**. Further, it will create **5 crore direct & indirect jobs by 2030**.
- India has ***EV30@30*** target - ***30% EV by 2030*** (from current **1%**) and ***80% commercial EVs by 2030**
- As per **Rhodium group**, India will be **4th largest electric car market by 2030** and it must cut cost to compete with China
- Presently **7.8%** of all vehicle sales are EVs - **57%** of which are **e3W**
- **IEA** identified India as the **largest global market for electric three-wheelers** in 2024 

<b><u>NEED TO PROMOTE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN INDIA:</u></b> ***Development of electric vehicle sector will*** <b><u><i>benefit all citizens, will promote "Ease of Living" and enhance the quality of life</i></u></b>
1. **Energy security:** India imports around 80% of its crude oil requirements, thus EVs can help in **reducing import dependency, reducing CAD, saving forex,** etc.
2. **Transition to renewable** is simplified if vehicles run on electricity instead of fossil fuels.
3. Dealing with **air pollution and noise pollution** in big cities.
4. **Reducing Greenhouse gas emissions:** will help in achieving **Paris targets on Climate Change** as EV adoption also **nudges government to increase renewable electricity generation.**
5. **Competitive domestic manufacturing ecosystem:** can help accelerate **technology development** and **Make in India**
	- In automobile sector, India couldn't be a pioneer and had to depend on other countries to bring in the technology in the country and initiate the development of the sector.
	- Its important that in **EV sector, India develops its own indigenous industry** with focus on **3W EVs and 2W EVs**, which not only served our domestic needs but is also able to earn us export revenues in the future.
	- The development of electric sector will **provide employment opportunities through "Make in India"** across a range of skill sets and would also grow **export opportunities**
6. **Making transportation less expensive:**
	- #Eg travelling a **distance** of **100 km** in a **conventional vehicle costs INR 435**, whereas in an **EV it costs INR 97**
7. **Power manufacturing sector growth** in India
8. **EVs can act as a storage for Solar Energy** solving one of the major problems of EV sector and of solar energy. This can be done through schemes like, *charge EVs at lower cost during the day*.

<b><u>SCHEMES/PROGRAMS/POLICIES/INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE EVs IN INDIA:</u></b>
1. **Ministry of Heavy Industries** has formulated the **following 5 schemes for advancing and strengthening India's EV ecosystem** by supporting local manufacturing aligned with vision of **Atmanirbhar Bharat** and **Viksit Bharat 2047:**

			- In a departure from 2024 version of the policy, the government has also allowed **brownfield investments** following protests from Indian manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki India and Tata Motors.
2. **Lower Taxes:** **GST** on Electric Vehicles is on the lower bracket of **5%** as against **28% on conventional vehicles**
	- Budget 2019-20: **Tax subsidies for EV:** Additional income tax deduction of INR 1.5 lakh on the interest paid on the loans taken to purchase electric vehicles before 31st March 2023.
3. **EV Policies of Select States and UTs:** a number of state/UT governments ( #Eg Delhi) have formulated policies for the successful implementation of the **National EV Mission** and the **FAME scheme**.
4. **E-Amrit Portal:** it is a web portal on electric vehicles and provide **one stop solution for all information related to EVs** - bursting myths around the adoption, details about policies/subsidies, etc.

<b><u>CHALLENGES OF INDIA'S EV SECTOR AND THE WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. ***Battery cost:*** commercial EVs run on *Lithium-based batteries* and India **imports** most of the Lithium and Lithium-ion batteries making it very expensive - ***40% cost is of battery only***
	- Therefore, India needs to **invest in research for battery technology and material sciences**
2. ***Low Lithium Reserves in India:*** *Chinese firms are already occupying stakes in countries such as Chile, Bolivia, and Australia* which have substantial reserve, thus creating a kind of monopoly situation.
	- While the newly found ***Salal Haimana*** Lithium reserves are not **commercially viable**
		- Only about **0.02 MnTn** as **Lithium Carbonate**
		- Reserves hold minerals in **clay deposits**
		- **Auctions failed - not enough bidders**
	- Need to shift towards the ***Katghora*** Lithium reserves in Chattisgarh with **hard-rock** ***Pigmite*** **deposits** and look for **international collaborations** and **attract investment and foreign expertise** in Lithium mining.
	- We also need to **set up battery recycling capacity** in India - ***Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022*** has to be effectively implemented.
	- Commercialize indigenous battery recycling technologies like the **Black Mass Recovery** technology.
	- Further, India needs to **invest in research into alternative battery technologies** using different metals:
		- ***Aluminium, Sodium, & Zinc*** based batteries have emerged as viable alternatives to Lithium ones.
			- Aluminium based batteries could be beneficial for India as **India is the 2nd largest Aluminum producer in the world** and the **production has been increasing**. It is also **cheaper** that Lithium, this reducing the cost of EV batteries. Further, Aluminum batteries can have **higher energy density** than Lithium batteries.
			- **Sodium ion battery technology** is another option.
3. ***Limited availability of Charging Infrastructure and long time for EV charging:***
	- City planners, Municipal bodies, local administrative bodies, electricity companies, government, etc. need to **build a comprehensive policy document** to meet future charging demands of EV.
	- Further, the option of **battery swapping stations** also need to be **explored**
		- There are some practical challenges associated with this as batteries need to **standardized** and made **interoperable** with all EVs for easy removal and reattachment of battery.
		- With improved battery swapping services and ***battery-as-a-service (BaaS)*** setting in, sales in the segment could further grow.
	- **Provide information on public chargers to the users of EVs** through **online maps/apps** and other means such as physical signage.
4. **Safety issues:** occurrence of some incidents involving EV catching fire has raised doubt about its safety.
	- In response to this, **MoRt&H have developed a new safety standards** for **EV batteries**.
5. **Shortage of Human resources and Technical expertise:**
	- Lack of **engineers** and even **mechanics**
	- India need to allow **foreign manufacturers** to **manufacture in India** including Chinese as, **without Chinese tech,** India would face **supply shortages, delayed rollouts, and reduced product diversity**.
	- However, **over-dependence** could undermine India's long term goal - India must work on promoting **join ventures** with global leaders in EV manufacturing like ***BYD, VinFast***, etc.
6. **Subsidizing e-vehicles:** is being criticized as some activists feel that it is **subsidizing a small affluent section of the car-owning population**, when there are better alternatives to fossil fuels available.
7. **E-vehicles alone will not decarbonize transport:** we will have to decarbonize the electricity sector.
8. **Other Infrastructure concerns:** poor **electricity distribution network**, **surging electricity demand**, etc.
9. **Public awareness:** there is still very less understanding of EVs among the public, in terms of its benefits, risks, subsidies available, charging methods and tariffs, battery life, maintenance costs, and resale value.
	- A significant step to improve public awareness is the ***e-Amrit portal***

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> ***Electric vehicles have the potential to positively impact India's environment, climate target, economy, and job market. We need to prepare ourselves by installing charging infrastructure, battery making factories and smart incentives for car companies and consumers to go electric***.
