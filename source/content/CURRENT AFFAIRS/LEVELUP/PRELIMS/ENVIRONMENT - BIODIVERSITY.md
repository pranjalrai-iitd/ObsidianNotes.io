## 1. GREAT INDIAN BUSTARD

- **News:**
	- Wildlife activist *Radheshyam Bishnoi* passed away in a tragic road accident. He was known in the wildlife conservation circles across India for his passion to save the *endangered GIB, Chinkara, Blackbuck* and other fauna of Thar. Environmentalists have suggested that he must be remembered as the ***"Godawan Man of India"***.
		- **Godawan** is local name for the Great Indian Bustard.
- **Physical Features:**
	- A large bird with horizontal body and long legs giving it an ostrich like appearance. It is **largest of the 4 Bustard** species found in India. The other three are ***MacQueen's Bustard, Lesser Florican, and Bengal Florican.***
	- Among the **heaviest of flying birds**. It is unimstakable with its ***black cap contrasting with pale head and neck.***

- **Protection status:**
	- IUCN - CR
	- WPA - Schedule I
	- CITES - Appendix 1
	- CMS - Appendix 1
- **Habitat and Distribution:** 
	- **Historic range** included much of the *Indian subcontinent*, but it has now *shrunken to just 10%* of it.
	- **Habitats:** GIBs prefer **grasslands** as their habitat and are considered the **flagship bird species of the grassland ecosystem**. They also act as *barometer of the health of the grassland ecosystem*. They are **terrestrial birds** and thus spend most of their time on ground with *occasional flights to go from one part of their habitat to the other*.
	- **Food:** they feed on **insects, lizards, grass, seeds**, etc.
	- Currently, they are found in **India (150 and decreasing)** and adjoining **Pakistan**. Often associated in the **same habitat as Black Buck**
	- In Pakistan - CR and few birds found in the *Cholistan desert*
	- Distribution in **India** is as follows:
		- **128** in **Rajasthan**
		- **10** in **Kutch** region of **Gujarat**
		- Very few in **Maharashtra, karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh**
		- Today the GIB are restricted to *isolated pockets* of **Rajasthan, MP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra, and Karnataka**
		- ***Desert National Park***, in **Rajasthan** has a good number of them
		- In fact, ***Rajasthan has 95% of World's population***
- **Key threats:**
	1. **Hunting:** initially is was a major concern
	2. **Threat to eggs** from stray dogs and other animals, as are laid on ground
	3. **Loss of habitat:**
		- **Grasslands** are increasingly converted into **agri-lands**
		- **Grasslands** are being used for **renewable energy power projects** like **solar power plants**
	4. **Accidents due to high tension electricity cables:** Researchers at ***WII*** consider it the biggest threat to GIBs. ***WII research has concluded that 18 GIBs die every year after colliding with high tension wires.***
		- **Reasons:**
			- Due to GIB's **poor frontal vision**, the birds can't spot the power line from a distance and are too heavy to change to course.
			- In **Kutch** and **Thar desert**, a lot of **transmission lines** have been set up as a number of **solar and wind power plants** have increased a lot.
- **Conversation Efforts:**
	- GIB is identified as one of the species under the **Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat (IDWH)** under MoEF&CC
	- In 2015, GoI has launched the **GIB species recovery program:**
		- Under the program, the **WII and Rajasthan forest department** have jointly set up **conservation breeding centers** where *GIB eggs harvested from the wild are incubated artificially and hatchlings raised in controlled environment*.
			- under this program, **First ever artificial insemination birth of GIB took place in Jaiselmer** in Oct, 2024:
				- The birth of GIB through artificial insemination at the <b><u><i>Sudasari Great Indian Bustard Breeding Centre</i></u></b> in **Jaiselmer** district is an extremely important step in conservation of GIB.
		- In May 2017, Rajasthan government announced setting up of the **Great Bustard Breeding Centre** at <b><u><i>Sorsan</i></u></b> in **Kota** district.
	- **Project GIB:** launched by the **government of Rajasthan** with an aim of *constructing breeding eclosures* for the species and *developing infrastructure* to reduce human pressure on its habitats.
	- **Plan of Firefly Diverters:** birds can *spot them from a distance of 50 meters* and change their fight direction to avoid collision with power lines.
		- **Supreme court** in April 2021, ordered that *all power lines in the GIB habitat be buried underground.*
			- However, in 2024, SC said that it would review its order after the central government found that it was *practically impossible to implement over long distances.*
