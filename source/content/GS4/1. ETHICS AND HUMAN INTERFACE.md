## #GS4_1 

<b><u>ETHICS:</u></b>
- #Definition Ethics refers to **externally set standards**, which act as an **external compass** to gauge the **rightness or wrongness** of an action, and helps in achieving ***"Summum Bonum"*** i.e, **highest good** 
- Ethics also refers to the study of one's ethical standards

The following tells us **what we ought to do**, but they might **NOT be ethical:**
- Religion/Supernatural
- Science
- Laws, rules and regulations
- Society/culture
- Feelings/conscience

<b><u>How to decide what is ethical?</u></b> *use the 7 lenses/ schools of Ethics:*
1. <b><u>Rights lens:</u></b> Assumption that human beings have **inherent rights that preserve dignity**, and hence need to be respected
	- #Eg ***Right to life, Choices (free will), General human rights,*** etc.
	- The *ethical decision* is one that **preserves the moral rights of an individual**
		- #Eg ***PoSH Act 2013, Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019***
2. <b><u>Justice lens:</u></b> To give each person what is due, that is **fair and equitable treatment**
	- The *ethical decision* is one that is **just and fair**
	- #Eg ***Judiciary, Juvenile Justice Act 2015***
	- **Types of Justice:**
		- Social justice 
			- #Eg *Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016*
		- Corrective justice
			- #Eg *Punishment for misconduct*
		- Distributive justice
			- #Eg *Equal pay, free legal aid*
		- Retributive justice
			- #Eg *Capital punishment*
		- Reformative/Transformational justice
			- #Eg *Juvenile Justice Act 2015*
3. <b><u>Utilitarian lens:</u></b> 
	- The *ethical decision* is one that produces **greatest good for the greatest number** - ***Best outcome for as many stakeholders as possible***
	- It is a **results based approach** and **cost-benefit analysis** is used to determine the same
	- #Eg ***Plastic use by companies***
4. <b><u>Common Good lens:</u></b> The *ethical decision* is one which **adds good for each individual**. Common good approach focuses on the ***shared interests*** of the society.
	- Thus, we don't use cost-benefit analysis but, the notion of ***community welfare***
	- The ethical decision is one, that is **good for all** (not just majority) and rests on ***compassion, kindness***, etc.
	- #Eg ***Public-infrastructure development, CSR***
5. <b><u>Virtue lens:</u></b> Ethical decisions are made by answering the question - ***"What kind of person will I become, If I do this?***
	- It is based on virtues such as #Eg ***integrity, honesty, love, generosity,*** ***tolerance*** guides our decisions 
6. <b><u>Case-ethics lens:</u></b> Ethical decisions are the one that takes into account the ***concerns, feelings, relationships of the stakeholders***
	- It helps in making **subjective choices**
	- #Eg ***Repeal of farm laws***, *public health policy taking into account food security, transportation, access and fair wages*, etc.
7. <b><u>Ethical egoism</u></b> by **Ayn Rand:** any decision taken for the **prosperity of self** is ethical and if all of us work for our own prosperity, entire society will be ethical.

- **What ought to be ethical according to one lens may no be according to others.** However, just by doing so, we are already in the process of using ethical teaching and testings, and this is the ***practical wisdom*** that we need to inculcate.

<b><u>Ethics ought to be taught?</u></b>
- Yes, as per ***Socrates (2,500 years ago)***, ethics is what we ought (not) to do. So, ethics is a **set of guidelines** that need to be **taught**.
- We also see ethics is **naturally taught** by our parents, peers, teachers, society and even nature.
- It will help us in **developing a strong ethical personality**
	- #Eg The *two gentlemen* in ***A.J. Cronins's "Two gentlemen of Verona"***
- <b><u>Conscience vs. Authority:</u></b> *Can authority teach ethics and affect individual conscience?*
	- <b><u>Milgram's experiment:</u></b> people will obey authority even if it is against their conscience #Eg Nazi camp
	- <b><u>Steven Sherman's experiment:</u></b> people will act as per their conscience it they reflect on the moral issue of the consequences

<b><u>Consistency and Ethics:</u></b>
- It is the **absence of contradictions** and **harmony** between one's **morals, ethics, and values**
- Consistency is the ***"hallmark of ethics"***
- Consistency is **necessary** but **not sufficient**
- Consistency should be maintained:
	- In **me vs other:**
		- #Eg *Going against the authorities Vs. accepting injustice*
	- Across **situations:**
		- #Eg *Fight for the rights of others as you fight for your own*

##### 1.C) CONSEQUENCES OF ETHICS IN HUMAN ACTIONS #GS4_1C 
The consequences that arise from choices show a spectrum of ethical consequences. The next step is to evaluate which consequence is better. The *7 lenses of ethics* along with the points of *Essence of Ethics* can be used here.
