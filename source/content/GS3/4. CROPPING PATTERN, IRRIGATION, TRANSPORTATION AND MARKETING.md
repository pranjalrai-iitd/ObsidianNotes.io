### 4.A.2) 10th AGRICULTURE CENSUS 2015-16 #Data #Update 

- **Quinquennial (every 5 years) Agricultural Census** by Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The **2015-16 census** was the ***10th Agri Census*** (first was done in 1970-71)
- **Highlights:**
	- **Decline in total operated are by 1.53%:** from *159.59 MnHa* to <b><u><i>157.14 MnHa</i></u></b> ***~ 47.8%*** of India's ***total area*** 
		- **State wise total operated are is as follows:**
			-  ***Rajasthan*** > *Maharashtra* > *UP* > *MP* > *Karnataka*
	- **Small (< 1Ha) and Marginal (<2 Ha) landholdings** constituted <b><u><i>86.21%</i></u></b> of the ***total landholding***, and it has ***increased by 1.2%*** from 2010-11
		- *Semi-Medium (2-4 Ha) & Medium (4-10 Ha) landholdings: 13.2%*
		- *Large (< 10 Ha) landholdings: 0.57%*
	- The ***small, marginal and medium landholdings*** constitute the *lion's share of operated area* - ***large landholdings account only for 9% of total operated area.***
		- *Small and Marginal landholdings area: 47.3%*
		- *Medium landholdings area: 43.6%*
	- **Average size of operational landholding:** *decreased* from *2.28 Ha (1970-71)* to *1.41 Ha (1995-96)* to ***1.08 Ha (2015-16)***
		- **USA** - *187 Ha*
		- **China** - **0.6 Ha** - *even less than India* -> much to learn from Chinese agricultural breakthrough
	- **Female operational landholding area:** ***11.72%*** of the total operated area. However, as per **Census 2011** around **30.3% cultivators were female** and **42.6% of agricultural labourers were female**.
		- As per **Economic Survey 2017-18** between 2001-2011, the number of female cultivators increased by **24%** - ***feminization of agriculture.***

### 4.A.3) KEY PROBLEMS FACE BY INDIA'S AGRICULTURE SECTOR

- **Small and "fragmented" landholdings:** *hinders investment* and *increased input-cost*
- **Insufficient access to quality inputs:** like quality seed - *low seed replacement rate* , *fertilizers*, etc.
- **Insufficient and inefficient irrigation system:** Only ***55%*** of cropped area is irrigated with *flood irrigation* (most inefficient) being the most common.
- **High dependency on monsoon:** Around **45%** are is *rain-fed*
	- Fluctuation of monsoon leads to fluctuation of agri-output. Down to Earth once quipped, ***"Monsoon is the chief Finance Minister of India."***
- **Low productivity:** compared to other countries like China

| CROP  | **YIELD IN INDIA** | **GLOBAL AVERAGE YIELD** |
| :---: | :----------------: | :----------------------: |
| Rice  |     2200 Kg/Ha     |        3025 Kg/Ha        |
| Wheat |     2750 Kg/Ha     |        3300 Kg/Ha        |
- **Poor Agri-marketing and Agri-marketing infrastructure:** leading to high *post-harvest losses* amounting to **‚Çπ 1.5 Lakh Crore** annually as per **NITI Aayog**
- **Disguised unemployment:** with *zero marginal productivity of agricultural labour*. This is due to:
	- **Low** level of **mechanization**
- **Volatility in income of farmers:** #committee Only **6%** farmers are able to get **benefit of MSP,** as per ***Shanta Kumar committee***
	- Around **52%** farmers have **outstanding debt** with average debt of **‚Çπ 75,000 per household**
- **Poor land leasing and contract farming penetration:**
	- #Data **Agri Census** shows that only **0.36% farm land is leased** in India. 
		- This is because most land leasing happens **unofficially** due to **over-restrictive laws**.
	- #Data Only **2% area** is under **contract farming** in India
- **Sustainability concerns:** 
	- Declining **water table**
	- Excessive **fertilizer use** -> *Nitrogen pollution* -> **Land degradation**
	- **Global warming:** due to 
		- **Methane emissions (40% from agriculture)**, 
		- **Stubble burning**, and 
		- **N2O emissions (68% from agriculture)**

### 4.A.5) CROPPING PATTERN

<b><u>DEFINITION/ INTRODUCTION:</b></u> 
- Cropping pattern refers to **temporal and spatial distribution** of various types of crops being grown in the country

<b><u>FACTORS DETERMINING CROPPING PATTERN:</u></b>
1. <b><u>Seasonal factors:</u></b> this results into **3 major cropping seasons** in India:
	- **<b><u>Kharif</u></b>:** Begins with the *Monsoon* 
		- Sown in *June to October* and Harvested in *September-October*
		- #Eg Rice, Maize, Pulses, etc.
	- **<b><u>Rabi</u></b>:** *Summer harvest crops*
		- Sown in *October-December* and Harvested in *April-June*
		- #Eg Wheat, Barley, Mustard, etc.
	- **<b><u>Zaid</u></b>:** Between *Rabi* and *Kharif* during *March to June*
		- #Eg Watermelons, Fodder crops, etc.
2. <b><u>Geographical factors:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>Climate</u></b>:** #Eg ***Rice** requires **hot and humid climate***, whereas ***Wheat** is grown in **cool and dry conditions***.
	2. **<b><u>Soil</u></b>:** Fertility, nutrients, etc. determine which crop is suitable for the soil. #Eg ***Black soil*** is suitable for ***Cotton***.
	3. **<b><u>Topography</u></b>:** #Eg ***Coffee*** is grown on **slopes with shades** provided by other trees.
3. <b><u>Productivity and financial benefits:</u></b> 
	- After the **Green revolution**, the improved productivity of **rice & wheat** led farmers in *Punjab & Haryana* to shift  from Millets to rice and wheat.
	- More farmers in *Gujarat & Maharashtra* shifted to **Cotton** when its productivity increased after the release of **BT-Cotton**.
4. <b><u>Socio-economic factors:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>Landholding size</u></b>:** **large and well-off farmers** may grow **cash crops** and focus on market demand. Whereas, **Small and marginal farmers** perform ***subsistence agriculture***, growing cereals for their own consumption. 
	2. **<b><u>Food habits</u></b>** also determine cropping pattern - #Eg **Habit of Millets reduced** which reduced it's production
	3. **<b><u>Labour availability</u></b>:** for some crops like **cotton, tea, coffee**, etc. cheap and trained workforce is a pre-requisite and thus, they are grown in **plantations**
5. <b><u>Infrastructure:</u></b> such as
	1. **<b><u>Irrigation facilities</u></b>:** #Eg with *increased penetration of irrigation*, farmers in *Punjab* facilitated shift from Millets to Rice.
	2. **<b><u>Storage and food-processing facilities</u></b>:** facilitates production of **perishable horticulture** like *Tomato, Onion & Potatoes (TOP).* 
6. <b><u>Government policies:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>MSP and FRP regime</u></b>:** in which **open ended procurement of wheat and rice** happens, promotes the **rice-wheat cropping pattern**. Similarly, **assured FRP for sugarcane** promotes *sugarcane production*.
	2. **<b><u>Insurance penetration</u></b>:** can contribute to **diversification of cropping pattern** as farmers will be more read to take risks.
7. <b><u>Scientific advancements:</u></b> 
	- **Transgenic crops:** #Eg With availability of **BT-Cotton**, the **acreage under Cotton** increased.
	- **AI and precision agriculture:** enabling diversification of cropping pattern by passing factors like climate, etc.
8. <b><u>Historical factors:</u></b>
	- #Eg **Saffron cultivation** in **Jammu & Kashmir**
	- #Eg **Kalajeera rice** in **Koraput, Odisha**
	- #Eg **Tea gardens** in **North East India** and colonial legacy

<b><u>KEY CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT CROPPING SYSTEM IN INDIA:</u></b>
1. **Depleting ground water levels:** due to excessive extraction of water to support the **rice-wheat cropping pattern**
2. **Land degradation:** excessive use of **chemical fertilizers, insecticides** etc.
3. **Development of resistant pests:** #Eg **Pink Boll worm** has become resistant to **BT toxin** produced by **BT Cotton**
4. **Threat to nutritional security and food diversity:** as the consumption of **Millets**, which are **super-food** has reduced and consumption of **rice & wheat** increased.
5. **Climate change:** the **rice dominated cropping system** produces a lot of **Methane** contributing to Climate change.
6. **Disguised unemployment:** due to **cropping pattern not evolving with the subdivision of land**. #Eg Farmers are still not shifting to Pulses, Oilseeds and Millets.
7. **Distress migration:** from rural to urban areas due to **non-remunerative nature of agriculture** due to **lack of diversification** and **reducing productivity**.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> India's **cropping pattern** needs to evolve based on a **holistic and integrated approach** with focus on ***crop diversification, water-use efficiency, marketing reforms*** most importantly ***changing demand of end consumers.***
