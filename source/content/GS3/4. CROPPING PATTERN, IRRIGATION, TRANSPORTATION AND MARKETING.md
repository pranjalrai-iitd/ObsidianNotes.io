### 4.A.2) 10th AGRICULTURE CENSUS 2015-16 #Data #Update 

- **Quinquennial (every 5 years) Agricultural Census** by Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The **2015-16 census** was the ***10th Agri Census*** (first was done in 1970-71)
- **Highlights:**
	- **Decline in total operated are by 1.53%:** from *159.59 MnHa* to <b><u><i>157.14 MnHa</i></u></b> ***~ 47.8%*** of India's ***total area*** 
		- **State wise total operated are is as follows:**
			-  ***Rajasthan*** > *Maharashtra* > *UP* > *MP* > *Karnataka*
	- **Small (< 1Ha) and Marginal (<2 Ha) landholdings** constituted <b><u><i>86.21%</i></u></b> of the ***total landholding***, and it has ***increased by 1.2%*** from 2010-11
		- *Semi-Medium (2-4 Ha) & Medium (4-10 Ha) landholdings: 13.2%*
		- *Large (< 10 Ha) landholdings: 0.57%*

### 4.A.3) KEY PROBLEMS FACE BY INDIA'S AGRICULTURE SECTOR

- **Small and "fragmented" landholdings:** *hinders investment* and *increased input-cost*
- **Insufficient access to quality inputs:** like quality seed - *low seed replacement rate* , *fertilizers*, etc.
- **Insufficient and inefficient irrigation system:** Only ***55%*** of cropped area is irrigated with *flood irrigation* (most inefficient) being the most common.
- **High dependency on monsoon:** Around **45%** are is *rain-fed*
	- Fluctuation of monsoon leads to fluctuation of agri-output. Down to Earth once quipped, ***"Monsoon is the chief Finance Minister of India."***
- **Low productivity:** compared to other countries like China

| CROP  | **YIELD IN INDIA** | **GLOBAL AVERAGE YIELD** |
| :---: | :----------------: | :----------------------: |
| Rice  |     2200 Kg/Ha     |        3025 Kg/Ha        |
| Wheat |     2750 Kg/Ha     |        3300 Kg/Ha        |
- **Poor Agri-marketing and Agri-marketing infrastructure:** leading to high *post-harvest losses* amounting to **‚Çπ 1.5 Lakh Crore** annually as per **NITI Aayog**
- **Disguised unemployment:** with *zero marginal productivity of agricultural labour*. This is due to:
	- **Low** level of **mechanization**
- **Volatility in income of farmers:** #committee Only **6%** farmers are able to get **benefit of MSP,** as per ***Shanta Kumar committee***
	- Around **52%** farmers have **outstanding debt** with average debt of **‚Çπ 75,000 per household**
- **Poor land leasing and contract farming penetration:**
	- #Data **Agri Census** shows that only **0.36% farm land is leased** in India. 
		- This is because most land leasing happens **unofficially** due to **over-restrictive laws**.
	- #Data Only **2% area** is under **contract farming** in India
- **Sustainability concerns:** 
	- Declining **water table**
	- Excessive **fertilizer use** -> *Nitrogen pollution* -> **Land degradation**
	- **Global warming:** due to 
		- **Methane emissions (40% from agriculture)**, 
		- **Stubble burning**, and 
		- **N2O emissions (68% from agriculture)**

### 4.A.5) CROPPING PATTERN

<b><u>DEFINITION/ INTRODUCTION:</b></u> 
- Cropping pattern refers to **temporal and spatial distribution** of various types of crops being grown in the country

<b><u>FACTORS DETERMINING CROPPING PATTERN:</u></b>
1. <b><u>Seasonal factors:</u></b> this results into **3 major cropping seasons** in India:
	- **<b><u>Kharif</u></b>:** Begins with the *Monsoon* 
		- Sown in *June to October* and Harvested in *September-October*
		- #Eg Rice, Maize, Pulses, etc.
	- **<b><u>Rabi</u></b>:** *Summer harvest crops*
		- Sown in *October-December* and Harvested in *April-June*
		- #Eg Wheat, Barley, Mustard, etc.
	- **<b><u>Zaid</u></b>:** Between *Rabi* and *Kharif* during *March to June*
		- #Eg Watermelons, Fodder crops, etc.
2. <b><u>Geographical factors:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>Climate</u></b>:** #Eg ***Rice** requires **hot and humid climate***, whereas ***Wheat** is grown in **cool and dry conditions***.
	2. **<b><u>Soil</u></b>:** Fertility, nutrients, etc. determine which crop is suitable for the soil. #Eg ***Black soil*** is suitable for ***Cotton***.
	3. **<b><u>Topography</u></b>:** #Eg ***Coffee*** is grown on **slopes with shades** provided by other trees.
3. <b><u>Productivity and financial benefits:</u></b> 
	- After the **Green revolution**, the improved productivity of **rice & wheat** led farmers in *Punjab & Haryana* to shift  from Millets to rice and wheat.
	- More farmers in *Gujarat & Maharashtra* shifted to **Cotton** when its productivity increased after the release of **BT-Cotton**.
4. <b><u>Socio-economic factors:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>Landholding size</u></b>:** **large and well-off farmers** may grow **cash crops** and focus on market demand. Whereas, **Small and marginal farmers** perform ***subsistence agriculture***, growing cereals for their own consumption. 
	2. **<b><u>Food habits and Consumption pattern</u></b>** also determine cropping pattern - #Eg **Habit of Millets reduced** which reduced it's production
	3. **<b><u>Labour availability</u></b>:** for some crops like **cotton, tea, coffee**, etc. cheap and trained workforce is a pre-requisite and thus, they are grown in **plantations**
5. <b><u>Infrastructure:</u></b> such as
	1. **<b><u>Irrigation facilities</u></b>:** #Eg with *increased penetration of irrigation*, farmers in *Punjab* facilitated shift from Millets to Rice.
	2. **<b><u>Storage, Food-processing facilities and Marketing conditions</u></b>:** facilitates production of **perishable horticulture** like *Tomato, Onion & Potatoes (TOP).* 
6. <b><u>Government policies:</u></b>
	1. **<b><u>MSP and FRP regime</u></b>:** in which **open ended procurement of wheat and rice** happens, promotes the **rice-wheat cropping pattern**. Similarly, **assured FRP for sugarcane** promotes *sugarcane production*.
	2. **<b><u>Insurance penetration</u></b>:** can contribute to **diversification of cropping pattern** as farmers will be more read to take risks.
7. <b><u>Scientific advancements:</u></b> 
	- **Transgenic crops:** #Eg With availability of **BT-Cotton**, the **acreage under Cotton** increased.
	- **AI and precision agriculture:** enabling diversification of cropping pattern by passing factors like climate, etc.
8. <b><u>Historical factors:</u></b>
	- #Eg **Saffron cultivation** in **Jammu & Kashmir**
	- #Eg **Kalajeera rice** in **Koraput, Odisha**
	- #Eg **Tea gardens** in **North East India** and colonial legacy

<b><u>KEY CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT CROPPING SYSTEM IN INDIA:</u></b>
1. **Depleting ground water levels:** due to excessive extraction of water to support the **rice-wheat cropping pattern**
2. **Land degradation:** excessive use of **chemical fertilizers, insecticides** etc.
3. **Development of resistant pests:** #Eg **Pink Boll worm** has become resistant to **BT toxin** produced by **BT Cotton**
4. **Threat to nutritional security and food diversity:** as the consumption of **Millets**, which are **super-food** has reduced and consumption of **rice & wheat** increased.
5. **Climate change:** the **rice dominated cropping system** produces a lot of **Methane** contributing to Climate change.
6. **Disguised unemployment:** due to **cropping pattern not evolving with the subdivision of land**. #Eg Farmers are still not shifting to Pulses, Oilseeds and Millets.
7. **Distress migration:** from rural to urban areas due to **non-remunerative nature of agriculture** due to **lack of diversification** and **reducing productivity**.

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> India's **cropping pattern** needs to evolve based on a **holistic and integrated approach** with focus on ***crop diversification, water-use efficiency, marketing reforms*** most importantly ***changing demand of end consumers.***

### 4.A.5) CROP DIVERSIFICATION

<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b> Crop diversification refers to **shift in cropping pattern from one or a few crops to other crops** which are *more profitable, sustainable* or *less resource intensive.*

<b><u>ADVANTAGES OF CROP DIVERSIFICATION:</b></u>
- **Crop Diversification leads to higher crop yield and higher farmer incomes:**
	1. **Improved soil health:** Different crops have *varied root structure, nutrient requirements,* and *residue composition*. Crop diversification **reduces risk of nutrient imbalances or deficiencies. **
	2. **Planting diverse crops disrupt pests, weeds and disease cycle:** resulting in better *pest-management* and higher **yields.**
	3. **Fighting the challenges of Monoculture:** particularly in **Punjab & Harayana** where the **rice-wheat cropping pattern** has resulted in **soil salination, water table decline**, and **low productivity**.
	4. **Resilience against risks:** reduces **farmer's vulnerability** from *adverse weather conditions, pests and market fluctuations* which may affect single crop.
	5. **Higher income:** as increased **crop yield** and **high value crops** can be grown #Eg *Horticultural crops*
- **Crop diversification is beneficial for environment:**
	1. **Supports biodiversity:** by providing **habitats for pollinators** and offering **disease resilience** and  **reduced pests.**
	2. **Reduces pollution:** by reducing the demand of **chemical fertilizers** and prevents them from leaching out to water bodies.
	3. **Reduces water demand:** #Eg Diversifying to **millets/pulses** from **rice/wheat** can result in lesser irrigation requirements, thus helping halt the declining water table.
- **Economic growth and development:**
	1. **Food security and Nutrition:** crop diversification with adaptation of **millets** will promote **healthier diets** and will help address **nutritional deficiencies.**
	2. **Benefit animal husbandry sector:** by **improving availability of fodder crops**
	3. **Rural employment:** crop diversification can help enhance the **availability of raw materials for food processing industries**, increasing employment opportunities. #Eg *Potato seeds offered by Lays*
	4. **Diversifying export basket** through diversified crop production helping reduce India's *Current Account Deficit*

<b><u>STEPS TAKEN TO PROMOTE CROP DIVERSIFICATION:</u></b>
1. **Crop Diversification Program (CDP)** - a *sub-scheme under RKVY*
	- Implemented in:
		- In **original green revolution states** (Punjab, Haryana, western UP) to **diversify paddy areas** towards less water requiring crops like **oil seeds & pulses.**
		- In **tobacco growing areas** (Andhra, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, TN, UP etc.) tto **shift tobacco farmers to alternate crops.**
	- Under CDP, **assistance is provided to states** for conducting **cluster demonstration on alternate crops**, promoting water saving technologies, distribution of machinery, awareness, etc.
2. **Crop Diversification through Price Policy:** Increasing **MSP** for alternate crops like **Millets, Pulses and Oil-seeds**.
3. **PMFBY** has increased crops for which **insurance is provided** to encourage farmers to take risks and diversify their cropping pattern.

<b><u>FACTORS LIMITING CROP DIVERSIFICATION:</u></b>
1. **Government Policies:** like **MSP** distort agri-production towards **wheat and rice** where open ended MSP procurement happens - ***More than 50% MSP procurement happens for Rice and Wheat***
2. **Lack of awareness among farmers** linked with the ***cob-web phenomena*** results into **Monoculture** of *rice-wheat*.
3. **Increased cost due to initial investment:** Diversification may require **new seeds, fertilizers**, and **training** which can increase cost in short-term.
4. **Limited input availability:** poor **availability of seeds, planting materials,** etc. hinders crop-diversification.
5. **Dominance of small and marginal farmers (86%)** performing ***"subsistence agriculture"*** with limited ability to take risks and diversify.

<b><u>WAY FORWARD:</u></b>
1. **Rationalize MSP:** controlling MSP on wheat and rice while increasing MSP on pulses/millets along with **increased procurement** of pulses and millets.
2. **Soil Health Cards and other initiatives:** to introduce **decision-support services** among the farmers about different crops which are suitable for soil type, thus encouraging diversification.
3. **Enhancing access to inputs** and strengthening agricultural **extension services**
4. Initiatives like **micro-irrigation** and **mechanization** can contribute to crop-diversification as envisioned under the *Crop Diversification Program*
5. **Using emerging technologies:** like *Precision agriculture, Crop Modelling & Data Analytics, Genetic Engineering, etc.* to develop **HYV** crops which would promote diversification.
6. **NGOs** must be partnered with to increase **awareness** about crop diversification

<b><u>EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION:</u></b>
1. **Awareness:** through **Mobile Apps** that can **offer decision-support services** and offer **training** to farmers.
2. **Precision agriculture:** through **IoT sensors** that can help **increase crop-productivity** thus, providing an opportunity to diversify.
3. **Agri-robots:** to reduce **human labour cost** in harvesting thus, helping **reduce costs** and **maximize earnings** enabling the farmer to diversify.
4. **Crop Modelling and Data Analytics:** by **predictive models** help farmers **identify suitable crops** through a *data-driven approach*.
5. **Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology:** opportunity to develop **new crop varieties** with enhanced traits such as *disease resistance, drought tolerance,* and *improved nutritional content.*
6. **Indoor and vertical farming:** allowing **variety of crops** in a controlled environment with *high flexibility* and *increased productivity* **regardless of geographical or climatic limitations**.
7. **Hydroponics and Aeroponics:** enabling the production of **wide range of crops in limited space** enabling **year-round diversified cultivation.** 

<b><u>CONCLUSION:</u></b> 
- Policymakers, agricultural institutions, and market stakeholders need to collaborate to create an enabling environment that supports and incentivizes crop diversification in agriculture. 
- By leveraging **emerging technologies**, farmers can **overcome traditional limitations, make data-driven decisions, and explore diverse crop options that were previously unviable or challenging.*** 
- ***Crop diversification can be the driver to a new "evergreen revolution".***
